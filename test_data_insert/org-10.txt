With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent auxiliary systems have been widely used in various fields. As a sport, volleyball has high technical requirements, and the traditional volleyball teaching method has certain limitations. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to design an intelligent auxiliary system using artificial muscle integrated optical equipment to realize real-time monitoring and accurate evaluation of volleyball teaching, so as to assist coaches to accurately guide students’ movement skills. The system uses artificial muscle integrated optical equipment, and collects the movement data of students in volleyball training in real time through optical sensors. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze and identify the data to accurately assess the student’s movements. The system is equipped with an interactive interface that shows students correct demonstrations of movements and provides real-time feedback and guidance. Through experimental verification, the intelligent assistant system can monitor students’ movements in real time, accurately evaluate their technical level, and provide personalized guidance. With the aid of using the system, the volleyball technique level of students has been improved, and the teaching effect has been significantly enhanced.
