Implemented on contemporary smart automobiles. Several Artificial Intelligence foundation models have been suggested for intelligent sensing to identify familiar item categories in novel yet similar situations. Nevertheless, the basic models of smart sensing still face difficulties in accurately identifying all item types in both familiar and unfamiliar situations. This letter seeks to expand the scope of smart sensing research for intelligent cars. We begin by providing an overview of the existing foundation models that are commonly employed, as well as the fundamental intelligence required for the intelligent sensing of vehicles. Next, we elucidate the concept of Sora-based Parallel Vision, which aims to upgrade the underlying models of intelligent sensing from a basic level (1.0) to an advanced one (2.0) and ultimately to a comprehensive level (3.0). The text presents a number of illustrative case studies that demonstrate the possible applications of Sora-based Parallel Vision. It also outlines the future research path of this technology.
