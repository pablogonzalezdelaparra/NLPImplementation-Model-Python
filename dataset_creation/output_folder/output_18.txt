Utilizing AI and machine learning, namely the vision transformer technique, for bacterial detection shows great potential in addressing the shortcomings of conventional methods. This approach offers improved speed and accuracy in identifying disease-causing bacteria such as E. coli. Research is currently being conducted to evaluate the usefulness of water in microbiology, specifically in relation to the presence of coli and salmonella, which are important for human survival. This study presents a groundbreaking positional self-attention transformer model for categorizing bacterial colonies. By incorporating a positional self-attention mechanism, we improved the performance of the model, building upon the established success of transformer architectures in several fields. We introduced an innovative method for categorizing bacterial colonies by employing a positional self-attention transformer model. This enables the model to efficiently capture spatial linkages and patterns within bacterial colonies, hence leading to exceptionally precise categorization outcomes. The model was trained on a large collection of bacterial pictures, guaranteeing its resilience and ability to adapt to various colony kinds. The suggested approach effectively captured the spatial linkages and sequential patterns inherent in bacterial colony images, enabling more precise and resilient categorization. The suggested model exhibited exceptional performance, with a classification accuracy of 98.50% in identifying bacterial colonies. This innovative methodology outperforms conventional methods by successfully capturing complex spatial interactions within microbial structures, providing unparalleled precision in detecting small morphological differences. The model's capacity to adjust to various colony shapes and arrangements is a notable progress, with the potential to revolutionize the field of bacterial colony categorization using cutting-edge deep learning methods. The model's high classification accuracy indicates its potential for practical applications in early detection of infectious diseases and focused treatment development. This study's results highlight the efficacy of integrating positional self-attention into transformer models for image-based classification tasks, namely in the field of bacterial colony analysis.
