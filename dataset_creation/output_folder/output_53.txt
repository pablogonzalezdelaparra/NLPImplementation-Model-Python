This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of the correlation between artificial intelligence and emotions in the field of education in Latin America and the Caribbean. The PRISMA systematic review approach was employed to provide an overview of the current state of research on this topic, considering theories, methodologies, countries, and educational levels. A total of fifteen studies, which specifically concentrate on Brazil and Colombia, university-level education, students as the primary subject of analysis, and employ approaches that integrate facial recognition, psychology, and software, were ultimately chosen for publication. The aim is to enhance the depth of research in several areas by incorporating different theories and approaches.
