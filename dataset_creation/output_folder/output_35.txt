Over the past few decades, there has been a consistent growth in the number of vehicles on the road, mostly driven by the increasing need for urban transportation and modern logistics. Two of the numerous adverse consequences resulting from the proliferation of vehicles on the road, which also hinder economic progress, are heightened traffic congestion and traffic accidents. The aforementioned challenges can be effectively addressed by enhancing the intelligence of vehicles and minimizing their need on human intervention. In the last century, numerous countries have carried out substantial research that has driven the automation of road vehicles. All major motor manufacturers worldwide are currently actively pursuing the development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies. Without a doubt, the extensive adoption of self-driving vehicles is closer than we perceive, thanks to the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). AI has become an essential component for autonomous vehicles to accurately sense their environment and make real-time judgments. The advancement of AI is propelled by the expansion of big data generated by several sensing devices and state-of-the-art computing resources. In order to fully understand the functions of AI in AV systems, it is necessary to first analyze the development and history of AI.
