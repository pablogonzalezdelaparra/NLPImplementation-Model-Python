The future viability of the worldwide automobile sector will be significantly impacted by the fourth industrial revolution and the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). The future is expected to be shaped by new industry norms, such as the growing prevalence of autonomous self-driving technology, revised safety standards, more intricate insurance regulations, the evolving social acceptance of technological advancements, the need for city infrastructure that bridges the digital divide, and the emergence of disruptive business innovation through strategic collaborations involving open-source AI. This chapter examines the crucial elements of autonomous vehicles (AVs) by utilizing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) in radar and laser technology. It also considers commercial risks, customer behavior in self-driving vehicles, limitations imposed by city infrastructure, and societal adjustments to new technology. The future direction of the autonomous vehicle (AV) business is anticipated to be shaped by the interaction of commercial, social, risk, infrastructure, and regulatory factors, which will have different effects on the industry's stakeholders. This study forecasts that the most probable sustainable future for the AV industry will be shaped by: (1) AI's pulsed laser LiDAR technology with a sufficiently high frequency of data collection and the need for GPS bi-directional cloud technology, (2) collective insurance instead of individual liability, (3) smart city infrastructure that will likely result in significant disparities in digital connectivity across different transportation regions, leading to regional inequality, and (4) customers who strongly favor a semi-autonomous vehicle controlled by a human driver rather than full machine autonomy.
