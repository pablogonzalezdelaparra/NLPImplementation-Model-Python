An autonomous vehicle is a sophisticated and all-encompassing application of advanced technology. It incorporates functions such as scene perception, optimization calculation, multi-level assisted driving, and more. This is achieved through the use of computer vision, sensors, information fusion, information communication, high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and automatic control technologies. Computer vision is a crucial component of autonomous driving, serving as a primary means of data processing. Furthermore, it introduces groundbreaking transformations to the forthcoming transportation system. Image processing and computer vision are crucial in autonomous driving as they allow vehicles to observe and comprehend their surroundings, leading to intelligent decision-making and control. This paper discusses the application of computer vision and artificial intelligence in automatic driving. It focuses on image processing technology, including camera and sensor technology, image acquisition and preprocessing, feature extraction, and object detection. The goal is to explore the use of computer vision algorithms in automatic driving. The study of lane keeping and recognition, obstacle detection and avoidance, and traffic signal and sign recognition holds immense practical importance.
