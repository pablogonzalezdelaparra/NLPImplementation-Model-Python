Health and well-being sectors are increasingly utilizing interactive software agents, such as chatbots. In applications where agents interact with users in interpersonal discussions, such as coaching, providing comfort, or behavior-change interventions, there is a growing demand for understanding the empathetic capacities of these agents. Currently, there are no existing instruments capable of performing that task. To comprehend empathic capacities in interactive software agents, it is essential to possess a clear and exact understanding of empathy. The literature explores multiple interpretations of empathy, although a formal definition remains elusive due to the lack of unanimity. The text presents the development of a formal definition, or ontology, of empathy in interactive agents for health and well-being. This is achieved through a thorough literature survey and qualitative study of contemporary efforts. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of a formal definition by utilizing it as a means of evaluating empathy in two advanced health and well-being chatbots, namely Replika and Wysa. Our research indicates that our definition accurately encompasses the essential requirements for evaluating empathy in interactive agents, and how it might reveal and elucidate patterns in evolving perceptions of empathy across time. The concept, implemented in Web Ontology Language (OWL), can be used as an automated tool to enable systems to identify empathy in interactions. This can include an interactive agent evaluating its own empathetic performance or an intelligent system analyzing the empathic competence of its interlocutors.
