Precise trajectory tracking is not feasible in real-world situations, but it is often thought to be helpful in designing motion planning algorithms. This study presents a robust and dependable framework for motion planning and control. The system effectively addresses tracking problems resulting from imprecise tracking by coordinating the motion planning layer and controller. More precisely, the motion space is partitioned into areas that are considered safe and areas that are considered risky. This is achieved by determining the size of the movement constraint based on the tracking error, which is used to create the repulsive potential field. The collision-free waypoint set can be achieved by combining global search and the proposed waypoint set filtering approach. An optimization-based strategy is used to suit the planned trajectory by minimizing the acceleration of the reference trajectory. Subsequently, the intended path is examined and adjusted by the implemented anti-collision modification to guarantee safety. By employing invertible transformation and adaptive compensation, it is possible to confine the transient trajectory tracking errors within the intended region, even in the presence of actuator failures. The cooperation between the planning and control levels ensures safety and reliability even in the presence of imprecise tracking and actuator defects, as tracking error is carefully accounted for and managed at the planning level. The simulation and experimental results confirm the benefits and efficacy of the suggested motion planning and control system.
