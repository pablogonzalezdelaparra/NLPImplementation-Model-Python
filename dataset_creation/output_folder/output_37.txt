The future of autonomous vehicles depends on the merging of human-centric design with sophisticated AI capabilities. In the future, autonomous vehicles will not only transport passengers but also engage with and adjust to their preferences, ensuring a comfortable, efficient, and enjoyable travel. This study introduces a new framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the decision-making processes of autonomous cars. This framework aims to seamlessly incorporate the advanced language and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into autonomous vehicles by integrating their natural language capabilities and contextual understanding, utilizing specialized tools, synergizing reasoning, and collaborating with various modules. The suggested framework has the capacity to fundamentally transform the functioning of autonomous vehicles by providing customized support, ongoing acquisition of knowledge, and clear decision-making processes, ultimately leading to the development of safer and more effective autonomous driving technologies.
