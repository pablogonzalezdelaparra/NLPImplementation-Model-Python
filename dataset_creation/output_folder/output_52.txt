Artificial intelligence chatbots have become prevalent in the tourism business due to their cost-effectiveness and effectiveness. Nevertheless, academics have not devoted much attention to the impact of emotional expressions of chatbots on service outcomes. Utilizing the framework of expectation violations theory, we conducted three experiments to investigate the impact of emotional expressions displayed by chatbots on customer satisfaction. These studies were conducted within the context of providing tourist attraction suggestions. Chatbots' display of empathy towards customers might enhance customer satisfaction by minimizing instances where customer expectations are not met. Specifically, the direction of consumers towards their goals, the degree to which chatbot avatars resemble humans, and the type of relationship between customers and chatbots can influence the impact of emotional expression on expectancy violation. These findings contribute to the progress of research on the emotional expressions of chatbots and offer crucial insights for the implementation of chatbots in customer care within the tourism industry.
