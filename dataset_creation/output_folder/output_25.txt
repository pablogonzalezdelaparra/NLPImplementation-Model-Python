Facial recognition is a widely recognized and highly regarded area of study within the subject of Computer Vision, particularly due to the progress made in deep learning and the availability of extensive datasets. Facial recognition technology has made substantial advancements and is extensively utilized in practical situations. A comprehensive facial recognition system comprises three primary components: facial recognition, orientation, and representation. This method use deep convolutional neural networks to identify and align faces to a standard perspective, as well as extract information for recognition. This article offers a comprehensive summary of the most recent progress in various domains, demonstrating how deep learning has significantly improved their capabilities. The field of object detection in machine vision is a complex topic that necessitates substantial enhancements. Although picture classification accuracy has reached approximately 2.25%, surpassing human performance, object identification algorithms are still in their initial development phases. Presently, algorithms are able to attain a maximum of 40.8 Mean Average Precision Scores (MAPS) when applied to contemporary items. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to meticulously choose the dataset in order to obtain the most favorable outcomes.
