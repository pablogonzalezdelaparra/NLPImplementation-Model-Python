The amazing capacities of living beings derive from the way autonomy is manifested by their bodies. Across scales, living creatures connect computational or cognitive intelligence with physical intelligence through bodily form, material multifunctionality, and mechanical compliance. While soft robotics has advanced the design and construction of physically intelligent bodies, the integration of information-processing skills for computational intelligence remains a difficulty. Consequently, perception and control restrictions have hampered how soft robots are produced today. Progress toward untethered autonomy will need deliberate convergence in how the field codevelops new materials, fabrication methods, and control systems for soft robots. Here, a novel perspective is put forward: that researchers should employ tasks alone to impose material and information limits on soft robot design. A conceptual framework is proposed for a task-first design paradigm that sidesteps limits imposed by control tactics. This concept permits emergent synergies between material and information processing features of soft matter to be conveniently utilized for task-capable agents. Particular focus is made to the scale dependence of solutions. Finally, an outlook is offered on new research opportunities for gaining autonomy in future soft robots as huge as elephant trunks and as little as paramecia.
