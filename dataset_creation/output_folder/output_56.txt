INTRODUCTION: In recent times, there has been a merging of Artificial Intelligence with neuroscience, specifically in the examination of the brain and the creation of therapies for neurological illnesses. Artificial neural networks and deep learning offer significant understanding of neural processing and brain functionality. Current study endeavors to elucidate the mechanisms by which brain processes impact an individual's subjective well-being. OBJECTIVES: To assess the correlation between neuroscience and happiness by examining the progress made in Artificial Intelligence. PROCEDURE: A bibliometric study was conducted using publications retrieved from the Scopus database between 2013 and 2023. Additionally, the VOSviewer software was employed for data processing. The study yielded a total of 603 publications, indicating that the United States (184), United Kingdom (74), and China (73) have the highest scientific output. The Co-occurrence - Author Keywords analysis produces three groups. The initial cluster, denoted by the color red, pertains to the use of Artificial Intelligence in forecasting happiness. The subsequent cluster, represented by the color green, is connected to the implementation of Artificial Intelligence tools in the field of neuroscience. Lastly, the third cluster, indicated by the color blue, is concerned with the intersection of neuroscience and psychology. CONCLUSION: Neuroscience research has made substantial advancements in comprehending mental functions such as emotions and consciousness. Neuroscience has embraced the concept of happiness and is now adopting a methodology that utilizes Artificial Intelligence to gather empirical data in order to comprehend individuals' well-being.
