How can the risks associated with autonomous vehicles (AVs) be allocated among those in regular road traffic? The extensive body of literature on the ethics of autonomous vehicles (AVs) mostly focuses on moral decision-making in situations where collisions are inevitable. We advocate for expanding the discussion to encompass driving behaviors in ordinary road traffic, where prevalent ethical dilemmas develop as a result of the continual transfer of risk among road users. The allocation of risks in this scenario gives rise to ethical concerns that cannot be avoided through simplistic strategies like abruptly stopping. To assess participants' preferences regarding the driving actions of autonomous vehicles (AVs), we conducted a comprehensive survey in Germany using an interactive and visual representation of various traffic scenarios. The preferences of our participants differed dramatically from simple collision avoidance. Our participants demonstrated a willingness to assume risks on behalf of other road users, which suggests that the social dilemma of autonomous vehicles (AVs) may be reduced in hazardous conditions. Our research aims to establish a connection between engineers and philosophers in order to facilitate a more productive discussion on the ethical implications of autonomous vehicles.
