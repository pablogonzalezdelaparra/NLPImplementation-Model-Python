This study explores the complex connections between Emotional Intelligence (EI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Investment Decisions (ID) in the changing field of financial decision-making. Our research aims to examine how human emotional intelligence directly affects investment decisions and how artificial intelligence (AI) plays a role in moderating this process. We strive to understand the intricate relationship between human cognition and AI technology. By doing empirical study, we have discovered that EI has a direct impact on ID and also influences it indirectly through AI-mediated pathways. The results emphasize the crucial significance of emotional awareness in the decision-making process of investors, which is further enhanced by the technological capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI). It indicates that the majority of investors are swayed by the recognized emotional intelligence when making investment choices. In addition, AI has a significant influence on investors' decision-making process in the context of investing. However, AI only partially moderates the connection between emotional intelligence and investment decisions. This nuanced comprehension offers useful perspectives for financial professionals, politicians, and researchers, highlighting the necessity for comprehensive approaches that incorporate emotional and technological aspects in navigating the complexities of contemporary investment environments. This study adds to the current discussion about the mutually beneficial connection between human intuition and artificial intelligence in financial decision-making, highlighting their growing importance in investments.
