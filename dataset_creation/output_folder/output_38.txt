The potential of connected automated cars is diverse, and the progress of automation is closely linked to the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), which enables artificial intelligence (AI). The initial progress in engineering, electronics, and various other domains has served as a source of inspiration for AI. Multiple technological proposals exist for the implementation of automated cars. Automated vehicles significantly enhance traffic optimization and reduce casualties. When investigating vehicle autonomy, there are two main areas of development: high-level system integrations, such as new-energy cars and intelligent transportation systems, and backward subsystem progress, which focuses on improving sensor and information processing systems. The Advanced Driver Assistance System demonstrates outcomes that align with the anticipated challenges encountered in achieving vehicle autonomy. Situational intelligence, which involves the collection of vast quantities of data, is utilized for the precise construction of high-definition city maps, land surveys, and quality assessment of roadways. The transport's infotainment system incorporates advanced technologies such as gesture recognition, language translation, and environmental perception. These capabilities are enabled by a combination of camera, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and Radio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) sensors, which also allow for object localization within the scene. This chapter provides an overview of the history of autonomous vehicles (AV), current research areas in artificial intelligence (AI) technology for AV, state-of-the-art datasets used in AV research, and the various Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) algorithms that make up the AV system. It concludes by discussing the challenges and opportunities of AI in AV.
