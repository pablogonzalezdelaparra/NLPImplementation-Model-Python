Fuzzy logic appears as a strong tool for optimizing power flow solutions, particularly in the setting of deregulated power networks. By applying fuzzy logic controls, the perfect placement of distribution generators (DGs) may be discovered, guaranteeing the dependability indices are recognized through optimal power flow solutions and fuzzy logic controllers to ensure system feasibility. In a deregulated power system, smart placement of distribution generating units plays a critical role in minimizing power loss and boosting overall system performance by controlling swings. To detect areas of weakness, especially within transmission companies, accessing optimal power flow algorithms becomes vital in a deregulated power system. Both transmission and distribution networks should be adequately adjusted to alleviate congestion within the relevant organizations. The aggregator must assess system performance, leveraging data acquired from distribution and transmission businesses inside the deregulated electrical system.
