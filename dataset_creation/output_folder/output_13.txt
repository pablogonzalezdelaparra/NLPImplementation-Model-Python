Agriculture is of utmost importance and serves as the principal source of income for many countries. The presence of pathogens such as viruses, fungus, and bacteria in plants leads to a disease that results in significant financial losses for agricultural companies worldwide. Monitoring disease in plants is essential for ensuring the security of harvests in terms of both quality and quantity. Therefore, it is crucial to identify plant diseases. The plant disease condition is evident in specific plant organs. However, it is typically seen that the infection is found in specific leaves of plants. Researchers employ computer vision, deep learning, few-shot learning, and soft computing techniques to automatically detect plant diseases using leaf images. These strategies also help farmers take prompt and suitable actions to prevent a decrease in the quality and quantity of crops. By applying these techniques in illness recognition, it is possible to avoid the drawback of biased selection of disease features, extract relevant features, and enhance the speed and efficiency of technology and research. Furthermore, specific molecular approaches have been developed to proactively address and reduce the risk posed by pathogens. Therefore, this review assists the researcher in utilizing machine learning, deep learning, and few-shot learning to automatically identify diseases in plants. It also offers specific diagnostic strategies to prevent the occurrence of these diseases. Furthermore, this paper also addresses some of the forthcoming research endeavors in the field of disease classification.
