This research goes into the subtleties of adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control for nonholonomic multirobot systems defined by infinite actuator faults and range limits. To overcome these difficulties, we use the capabilities of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and employ adaptive approaches to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and uncertain parameters found in robotic dynamics. In the course of information exploration, the difficulties of collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance are continually present due to restrictions of distance and vision fields. In this context, we present a general barrier function and specified performance technique to overcome confined range obstructions efficiently. Furthermore, to reduce the number of controller executions and compensate for any effect arising from infinite actuator failures, robots engage with their leader at the moment of actuator faults using fewer network communication resources yet maintain uninterrupted tracking of the desired trajectory generated by the leader. With the aid of the dynamic surface technology, we propose a decentralized adaptive event-triggering fault-tolerant (ETFT) formation control strategy. We guarantee that all signals are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Ultimately, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of the ETFT control strategy for nonholonomic multirobot systems.
