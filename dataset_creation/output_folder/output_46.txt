The improvement in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) has prompted several academics to suggest the potential development of theory of mind (ToM) in artificial intelligence (AI). LLMs possess the ability to ascribe beliefs, goals, intentions, and emotions, and they will enhance their precision over time. Instead of using the conventional human approach of empathy, they acquire the ability to ascribe mental states by identifying linguistic patterns in a dataset that usually does not involve that specific individual. We inquire whether the lack of empathy in LLMs prevents them from respecting an individual's entitlement to be treated differently, namely, from forming evaluations of character and forecasts of conduct that demonstrate suitable consideration for a person's uniqueness. Can LLMs genuinely entertain the possibility that an individual's case is distinct due to internal mental states like as beliefs, goals, and intentions, or are they constrained to evaluate the case solely based on its resemblances to others? We suggest that the use of empathy is particularly important for recognizing the right to be unique, which is separate from the importance of being able to accurately predict outcomes, in which LLMs excel. In conclusion, we examine the inherent or purely practical worth of employing empathy to examine extraordinary circumstances, and we present theoretical and observational approaches to further explore this inquiry.
