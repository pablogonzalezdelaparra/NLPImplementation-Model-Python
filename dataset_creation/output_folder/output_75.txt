This paper applies a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to investigate voltage stability in a PV-based DC microgrid. Several photovoltaic (PV) modules, a DC-DC converter, and loads make up the microgrid. Due to the extensive usage of intermittent PV power, voltage stability is a major concern for DC microgrids and is challenging to fulfill. This paper presents an FLC-based voltage control technique that uses input elements including PV output power, DC-DC converter duty cycle, and load current to discover the best course of action for preserving the system's voltage stability. The FLC's performance is assessed by simulation, and it is designed to be resilient to parameter changes and uncertainties. The simulation results reveal that the suggested FLC-based control technique successfully maintains the microgrid's voltage stability under a variety of operational scenarios, including shifting solar irradiance and load changes. Moreover, the FLC works better than other control approaches.
