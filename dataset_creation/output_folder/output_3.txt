As of 2021, around 30 countries have published their national strategy for artificial intelligence (AI). These documents outline strategies and predictions addressing the influence of AI on policy sectors, such as education, and usually address the societal and moral consequences of AI. This article conducts a thematic analysis of 24 country AI policy strategies, examining the significance of education in the global AI policy discussion. The study reveals that discussions on policy mostly overlook the integration of AI in education (AIED), despite the significant importance placed on education's role in preparing a workforce for AI and cultivating more AI professionals. In addition, the ethical ramifications of AIED are given little consideration, despite the prevalence of AI ethics discourse in these texts. This indicates that AIED and its wider policy and ethical consequences have not been widely recognized by the general public and influential decision-makers. This is concerning because effective policy-making and thoughtful ethical deliberation are closely interconnected, as argued in this article. Based on these discoveries, the article utilizes a set of five AI ethics principles to explore how policymakers might more effectively integrate the consequences of AIED. Ultimately, the paper provides suggestions to AIED scholars on how to effectively interact with the policymaking process and conduct ethics and policy-oriented AIED research. The goal is to influence policy discussions in order to benefit the public.
