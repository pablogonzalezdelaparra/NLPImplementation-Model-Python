The field of engineering education is continuously adapting to stay abreast of the most recent technical advancements and fulfill the expanding demands of the engineering sector. An encouraging advancement in this domain is the utilization of generative artificial intelligence technologies, shown by the ChatGPT conversational bot. ChatGPT has the capacity to provide tailored and efficient learning experiences by offering students individualized feedback and explanations, along with generating lifelike virtual simulations for practical learning. Nevertheless, it is crucial to take into account the constraints of this technology. Generative AI systems like ChatGPT are reliant on the quality of their training data and have the potential to perpetuate biases or even produce and disseminate falsehoods. In addition, the utilization of generative AI in education gives rise to ethical apprehensions, including the possibility of students engaging in unethical or deceitful practices, as well as the potential displacement of human workers due to technological redundancy. Although the current status of generative AI technology, exemplified by ChatGPT, is remarkable, it is not without its limitations. However, it serves as a mere glimpse into the future potential of this field. Engineering educators must comprehend the ramifications of this technology and investigate how to modify the engineering education system to enable future engineers to utilize the advantages of generative AI while mitigating any adverse effects.
