The expanding population results in a larger consumer base, which in turn places greater demands on resources to meet the increasing needs of consumers on a daily basis. Given that technology is being employed to address various issues, it is reasonable to consider its application in resolving this particular problem as well. The concept aims to enhance the convenience and sophistication of the supermarket experience by eliminating the need for cashiers and queues, thereby enabling a seamless shopping experience. This project utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things to automate the operations of a supermarket, resulting in improved efficiency. To gain access, an individual just needs to enter the premises after scanning their QR code using the designated application, which contains their distinctive identification number. The system will document the customer's presence within the store. The shopping carts and baskets are equipped with sensors that can detect the presence or removal of products. The merchandise are positioned on shelves equipped with pressure sensors that can identify any instance of a product being lifted. These shelves are inaccessible and may only be opened with your shopping cards. Upon reaching the counter, simply swipe your card once more. The amount corresponding to your purchase will be withdrawn from your account, and you will receive a receipt. We anticipate offering this technology to many supermarket chains domestically and internationally, assisting them in its implementation through a modest one-time expenditure.
