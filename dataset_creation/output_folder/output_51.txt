Due to the swift advancement of artificial intelligence, a growing number of businesses are depending on the precision and effectiveness of deep learning algorithms. However, because of the incomprehensibility and opaque nature of deep neural networks, we can only receive outcomes without understanding the underlying rationale behind them. Some factions within the field of deep learning-based technologies are skeptical and resistant towards that. When it comes to emotion analysis applied in business and public opinion monitoring, decision-makers often struggle to have confidence in the results generated by computers that are supposed to be devoid of emotions, unless they are provided with an explanation. Mathematical-based explanation techniques frequently conceptualize emotion analysis as a categorization task. However, emotion should be distinguished from other kinds of tasks due to its reliance on human-specific elements and logic. This study presents a framework for explaining emotion analysis that is based on psychological theories that specifically focus on the stimulus aspect of classic emotion theories. This framework prioritizes the examination of the cause and stimulus of emotions as the rationale for deep learning-based emotion analysis. It consists of two primary elements: the extraction of the emotion cause and the visualization of words that trigger emotions.
