Well-being is a fundamental aspect of positive psychology, renowned for its beneficial impact on both the personal and professional aspects of individuals, as well as on teams and organizations. Comprehending and advocating for personal well-being is crucial for the health and sustained achievement of staff members. However, existing methods for evaluating subjective well-being rely on lengthy surveys and questionnaires, which hinder the ability to offer immediate feedback necessary for increasing awareness and modifying individual conduct. This research presents a framework for comprehending the process of non-verbal communication in cooperation. It utilizes video data to uncover important factors that can predict an individual's well-being in a team setting. The system utilizes advanced video acquisition methods and cutting-edge artificial intelligence tools to extract specific, comparative, and contextual features from panoramic video footage. Each time series undergoes statistical analysis, resulting in the creation of a dataset consisting of 125 features. These features are subsequently connected to PERMA surveys, which were designed within the field of positive psychology and measure Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishments. Machine learning algorithms are used to assess each component of the PERMA model as either a regression or classification problem. The methodology we employed was implemented in a specific instance, wherein 80 students participated in 20 groups over the course of one week, working together on a team assignment in a physical, in-person environment. As a result, we were able to develop multiple hypotheses that pinpoint the characteristics that influence an individual's well-being in a team setting. These encouraging findings indicate intriguing possibilities for further research, such as integrating various forms of media to analyze the personal well-being of individuals in a team setting.
