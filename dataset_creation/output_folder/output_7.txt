The utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in education has led to a rise in the quantity of published studies in this domain. Nevertheless, there have been no extensive evaluations carried out to thoroughly examine all the different facets of this domain. Using topic-based bibliometrics, we analyze 4,519 publications from 2000 to 2019 to uncover trends and subjects related to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in education (AIEd). The review findings indicate a growing inclination within the academic community towards utilizing AI for educational objectives. The primary areas of research encompass intelligent tutoring systems designed for special education, natural language processing applied to language education, educational robots utilized for AI education, educational data mining focused on performance prediction, discourse analysis in computer-supported collaborative learning, neural networks employed for teaching evaluation, affective computing employed for learner emotion detection, and recommender systems used for personalized learning. In addition, we explore the difficulties and potential future paths of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd).
