"This article delves into the intricacies of adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control for nonholonomic multirobot systems characterized by infinite actuator faults and range constraints. Traditional cheating detection methods have many disadvantages, such as difficult to detect covert equipment cheating, multi-source cheating, difficult to distinguish plagiarists from plagiarists, difficult to distinguish plagiarists from victims, or plagiarism from coincidences. To address these issues, we leverage the power of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and employ adaptive methods to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and uncertain parameters present in robotic dynamics. In the course of information exploration, the problems of collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance are ever present due to limitations of distance and visual fields. In this paper, the concept of knowledge point mastery Index is introduced to measure students’ mastery of a certain knowledge point, and a test method of cheating based on improved cognitive diagnostic model is proposed. Furthermore, to reduce the number of controller executions and compensate for any effect arising from infinite actuator failures, robots engage with their leader at the moment of actuator faults using fewer network communication resources yet maintain uninterrupted tracking of the desired trajectory generated by the leader. We guarantee that all signals are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Ultimately, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of the ETFT control strategy for nonholonomic multirobot systems. The experiments show that the precision and recall rate of this method are significantly higher than those of the method based on the false-same rate, the method based on the false-same rate and the right-same rate and the method based on the Person-Fit index.","This article delves into the intricacies of adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control for nonholonomic multirobot systems characterized by infinite actuator faults and range constraints.

In the course of information exploration, the problems of collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance are ever present due to limitations of distance and visual fields. In this regard, we introduce a general barrier function and prescribed performance methodology to tackle constrained range impediments effectively. Furthermore, to reduce the number of controller executions and compensate for any effect arising from infinite actuator failures, robots engage with their leader at the moment of actuator faults using fewer network communication resources yet maintain uninterrupted tracking of the desired trajectory generated by the leader. With the aid of the dynamic surface technology, we propose a decentralized adaptive event-triggering fault-tolerant (ETFT) formation control strategy. We guarantee that all signals are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Ultimately, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of the ETFT control strategy for nonholonomic multirobot systems.",0
"Machine learning (ML) is a form of artificial intelligence which is placed to transform the twenty-first century. Rapid, recent progress in its underlying architecture and algorithms and growth in the size of datasets have led to increasing computer competence across a range of fields. For these algorithms, choosing a proper fitness function plays an important role. These include driving a vehicle, language translation, chatbots and beyond human performance at complex board games such as Go. Here, we review the fundamentals and algorithms behind machine learning and highlight specific approaches to learning and optimisation. We then summarise the applications of ML to medicine. The fitness function orients the searching strategy of the algorithms to obtain best solutions. Feature selection (FS) is an optimisation problem that reduces the dimension of the dataset and increases the performance of the machine learning algorithms and classification through the selection of the optimal subset features and elimination of the redundant features.

"At present, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in industrial control, smart home and other fields has received good response. However, AI technology has certain requirements for computer performance, and also faces problems in network security, data analysis, human-computer interaction, etc. At present, the visual platform of embedded system has achieved remarkable results in practical applications, but its development has been seriously hampered by problems such as low overall development efficiency and unstable system performance. The test results showed that when other conditions were the same, students and experts had 83.5% and 90% positive evaluations of System X, and 16.5% and 10% negative evaluations respectively. This paper designed an EP Vision System (VS) based on AI technology. The platform combined the embedded hardware design with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to realize the intelligent robot interaction and target detection functions. It showed the positive relationship between AI technology and EP VS. The proportion of positive evaluation of System X was much higher than that of System Y, which indicated that System X can meet the actual application requirements and improve the system recognition efficiency to a certain extent. However, their positive evaluation of System Y only accounted for 19% and 4%, while the negative evaluation accounted for 81% and 96%.

"Interactive software agents, such as chatbots, are progressively being used in the area of health and well-being. The definition, implemented in Web Ontology Language (OWL), may serve as an automated tool, enabling systems to recognize empathy in interactions—be it an interactive agent evaluating its own empathic performance or an intelligent system assessing the empathic capability of its interlocutors. In the current state-of-the-art, there are no tools to do that. We present the potential of the formal definition in a controlled user-study by applying it as a tool for assessing empathy in two state-of-the-art health and well-being chatbots; Replika and Wysa. Our findings suggest that our definition captures necessary conditions for assessing empathy in interactive agents, and how it can uncover and explain trends in changing perceptions of empathy over time. Based on a systematic literature review and a qualitative analysis of recent approaches to empathy in interactive agents for health and well-being, a formal definition—an ontology—of empathy is developed. In order to understand empathic capabilities in interactive software agents, we need a precise notion of empathy. The literature discusses a variety of definitions of empathy, but there is no consensus of a formal definition. In such applications, where agents engage with users in interpersonal conversations for, e.g., coaching, comfort or behavior-change interventions, there is an increased need for understanding agents’ empathic capabilities.
