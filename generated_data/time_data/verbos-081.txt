Easy internet access and technological advancements had resulted in information overload and a plethora of options, making decision-making extremely difficult. Recommender System (RS) was a potential solution for assisting users in making decisions by recommending or predicting product ratings. Three fundamental forms of RS that used implicit or explicit feedback for recommendation were collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering. Ratings were the most common form of feedback, but product descriptions, reviews, images, audios, and videos were also important and could help improve the performance of the traditional RS. These additional variables could have a significant impact on RSâ€™s performance. Traditional RSs used approaches based on the nearest neighbor or other machine learning models, but thanks to recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning, RSs were now being developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which could efficiently exploit auxiliary information. In addition to comparing CNN-based RSs on common grounds, this article provided a full examination of CNN-based RSs and how they might use various types of auxiliary information. The study also discussed data characteristics, data statistics, and auxiliary information in a variety of publicly available datasets. Different evaluation measures for RSs were also discussed, and readers were provided with interesting challenges and open research issues.
