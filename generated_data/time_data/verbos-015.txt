Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) had emerged as a highly sensitive, adaptable, and effective technology for material analysis. Through employing thermochemical approaches, IGC provided crucial insight into physicochemical information of materials such as dispersive surface free energy, Gibbs surface energy components, and Guttamann Lewis acid-base parameters. In this comprehensive review, we delved into the historical background, instrumentation, and diverse applications of IGC. Researchers and practitioners found valuable information on the selection and description of numerous models used in IGC experiments. The applications of IGC spanned various domains, including polymers, medicines, minerals, surfactants, and nanomaterials. Furthermore, IGC facilitated the measurement of important parameters such as sorption enthalpy and entropy, surface energy components (dispersive and specific), co/adhesion work, glass transition temperature, surface heterogeneity, miscibility, solubility parameters, and specific surface area. These insights contributed to a deeper understanding of material behavior and aided in the design and optimization of advanced materials. Moreover, the integration of computer vision and image processing techniques with IGC had enhanced our understanding of materials' intricate surface texture, roughness, and related properties. This convergence of IGC with computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) presented exciting opportunities for future exploration of chemical materials, opening new avenues for research and discovery. This paper not only provided a comprehensive overview of IGC, its techniques, and applications but also highlighted the synergistic potential of combining IGC with AI and computer vision. The informative content and insights presented here benefited researchers, scientists, and professionals in the field of advanced materials, enabling them to leverage IGC and AI for innovative materials discovery and development.
