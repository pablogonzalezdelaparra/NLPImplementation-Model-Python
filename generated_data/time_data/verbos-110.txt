Artificial intelligence (AI) had recently become a very popular buzzword, as a consequence of disruptive technical advances and impressive experimental results, notably in the field of image analysis and processing. In medicine, specialties where images were central, like radiology, pathology, or oncology, had seized the opportunity and considerable efforts in research and development had been deployed to transfer the potential of AI to clinical applications. With AI becoming a more mainstream tool for typical medical imaging analysis tasks, such as diagnosis, segmentation, or classification, the key for a safe and efficient use of clinical AI applications relied, in part, on informed practitioners. The aim of this review was to present the basic technological pillars of AI, together with the state-of-the-art machine learning methods and their application to medical imaging. In addition, we discussed the new trends and future research directions. This helped the reader to understand how AI methods were now becoming an ubiquitous tool in any medical image analysis workflow and paved the way for the clinical implementation of AI-based solutions.
