Artificial intelligence chatbots have invaded the tourism industry owing to their low cost and high efficiency. However, the influence of emotional expressions of chatbots on service outcomes had not received much attention from researchers. Drawing upon expectancy violations theory, we explored how emotional expressions of chatbots affected customer satisfaction using three experiments in the context of tourist attraction recommendations. Chatbots' expressions of concern for customers could improve customer satisfaction by reducing expectancy violations. In particular, the customer's goal orientation, the human-likeness of chatbot's avatars, and the relationship type between customers and chatbots could moderate the negative relationship between emotional expression and expectancy violation. These findings advanced research on the emotional expressions of chatbots and provided critical insights for deploying chatbots in customer service in the tourism industry.
