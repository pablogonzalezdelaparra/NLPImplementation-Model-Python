Network news was an important way for netizens to get social information. Massive news information hindered netizens to get key information. Named entity recognition technology under artificial background could realize the classification of place, date and other information in text information. This article combined named entity recognition and deep learning technology. Specifically, the proposed method introduced an automatic annotation approach for Chinese entity triggers and a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that could achieve high accuracy with a small number of training data sets. The method jointly trained sentence and trigger vectors through a trigger-matching network, utilizing the trigger vectors as attention queries for subsequent sequence annotation models. Furthermore, the proposed method employed entity labels to effectively recognize neologisms in web news, enabling the customization of the set of sensitive words and the number of words within the set to be detected, as well as extending the web news word sentiment lexicon for sentiment observation. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model outperformed the traditional BiLSTM-CRF model, achieving superior performance with only a 20% proportional training data set compared to the 40% proportional training data set required by the conventional model. Moreover, the loss function curve showed that my model exhibited better accuracy and faster convergence speed than the compared model. Finally, my model achieved an average accuracy rate of 97.88% in sentiment viewpoint detection.
