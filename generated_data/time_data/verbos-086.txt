The latest effort in delivering computing resources as a service to managers and consumers represented a shift away from computing as a product that was purchased, to computing as a service that was delivered to users over the internet from large-scale data centers. However, with the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which were advancing customer experience automations in many application areas, such as recommender systems (RS), a need had arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that were at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard and technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduced the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Although numerous research studies had been published on FC “smart” applications, none hitherto had been conducted on fog-based smart marketing domains such as recommender systems. FC was considered a novel computational system, which could mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications requiring real-time data-driven decision making. This paper provided a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future research by using, as an example, the intersection of FC and RS. Indeed, our conceptualization of the “fog-based recommender systems” opened many novel and challenging avenues for academic research, some of which were highlighted in the later part of this paper.
