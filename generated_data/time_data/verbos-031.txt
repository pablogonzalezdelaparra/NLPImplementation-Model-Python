Autonomous vehicles (AVs) were expected to reshape future transportation systems, and decision making was one of the critical modules toward high-level automated driving. To overcome those complicated scenarios that rule-based methods could not cope with well, data-driven decision-making approaches had aroused more focus. The datasets to be used in developing data-driven methods dramatically influenced the performance of decision making; hence, it was necessary to have a comprehensive insight into the existing datasets. From the aspects of collection sources, driving data could be divided into vehicle-, environment-, and driver-related data. This study compared the state-of-the-art datasets of these three categories and summarized their features, including sensors used, annotation, and driving scenarios. Based on the characteristics of the datasets, this survey also discussed potential applications of datasets on various aspects of AV decision making, assisting researchers in finding appropriate ones to support their own research. The future trends of AV dataset development were summarized.
