In the evolving landscape of financial decision-making, this study delved into the intricate relationships among Emotional Intelligence (EI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Investment Decisions (ID). By scrutinizing the direct influence of human emotional intelligence on investment choices and elucidating the mediating role of AI in this process, our research sought to unravel the complex interplay between minds and machines. Through empirical analysis, we revealed that EI not only directly impacted ID but also exerted its influence indirectly through AI-mediated pathways. The findings underscored the pivotal role of emotional awareness in investor decision-making, augmented by the technological capabilities of AI. It suggested that most investors were influenced by the identified emotional intelligence when making investment decisions. Furthermore, AI substantially impacted investors' decision-making process when it came to investing; nevertheless, AI partially mediated the relationship between emotional intelligence and investment decisions. This nuanced understanding provided valuable insights for financial practitioners, policymakers, and researchers, emphasizing the need for holistic strategies that integrate emotional and technological dimensions in navigating the intricacies of modern investment landscapes. As the synergy between human intuition and artificial intelligence became increasingly integral to financial decision-making, this study contributed to the ongoing discourse on the symbiotic relationship between minds and machines in investments.
