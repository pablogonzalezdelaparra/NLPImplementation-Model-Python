This article employed a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to investigate voltage stability in a PV-based DC microgrid. Several photovoltaic (PV) modules, a DC-DC converter, and loads made up the microgrid. Due to the widespread use of intermittent PV power, voltage stability was a crucial problem for DC microgrids and was difficult to accomplish. This study proposed an FLC-based voltage control technique that leveraged input factors including PV output power, DC-DC converter duty cycle, and load current to identify the best course of action for preserving the system's voltage stability. The FLC's performance was assessed by simulation, and it was meant to be resilient to parameter fluctuations and uncertainties. The simulation results demonstrated that the suggested FLC-based control strategy successfully maintained the microgrid's voltage stability under a variety of operational circumstances, including changing solar irradiance and load variations. Moreover, the FLC performed better than other control methods.
