Throughout the last decades, the number of vehicles on the road had steadily increased due to the rising demand for urban mobility and contemporary logistics. Two of the many detrimental effects of more vehicles on the road, which also impeded economic development, were increased traffic congestion and traffic accidents. The issues mentioned above could be significantly resolved by making vehicles smarter by reducing their reliance on humans. Over the past century, various nations had conducted extensive research that had fueled the automation of road vehicles. The development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies was currently being pursued by all significant motor manufacturers worldwide. Undoubtedly, the widespread use of autonomous cars was more imminent than we realized given the development of artificial intelligence (AI). In order for AVs to perceive their surroundings and make the right decisions in real time, AI had emerged as a crucial component. This development of AI was being driven by the growth of big data from numerous sensing devices and cutting-edge computing resources. We must first examine AI's development and history in order to comprehend its functions in AV systems.
