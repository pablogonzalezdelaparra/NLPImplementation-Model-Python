Drug designing and development was an important area of research for pharmaceutical companies and chemical scientists. However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost imposed a hurdle and challenges that impacted drug design and discovery. Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also imposed an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology played a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms had modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms had been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthened the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provided an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which would eventually impact mankind.
