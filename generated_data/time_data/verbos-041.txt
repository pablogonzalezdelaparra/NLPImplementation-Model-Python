Human-AI interaction had become an important focus in the development of more responsive and humane technology. In this context, the use of artificial empathy strategies was of particular interest due to its potential in improving customer experiences affectively and socially. This research aimed to explore the optimization of human-AI interactions through the application of artificial empathy strategies in improving affective and social customer experiences. The research approach used was qualitative by reviewing various studies and related literature. The data sources used were journals, articles, and books that were relevant to the research topic. From the research results, it was found that the implementation of artificial empathy strategies in human-AI interactions had great potential to improve the quality of interactions and customer experiences. The use of technologies such as natural language processing, emotion recognition, and sentiment analysis could enable AI to respond more precisely and sensitively to user needs and emotions.
