As of 2021, more than 30 countries had released national artificial intelligence (AI) policy strategies. These documents articulated plans and expectations regarding how AI would impact policy sectors, including education, and typically discussed the social and ethical implications of AI. This article engaged in thematic analysis of 24 such national AI policy strategies, reviewing the role of education in global AI policy discourse. It found that the use of AI in education (AIED) was largely absent from policy conversations, while the instrumental value of education in supporting an AI-ready workforce and training more AI experts was overwhelmingly prioritized. Further, the ethical implications of AIED received scant attention despite the prominence of AI ethics discussion generally in these documents. This suggested that AIED and its broader policy and ethical implications—good or bad—had failed to reach mainstream awareness and the agendas of key decision-makers, a concern given that effective policy and careful consideration of ethics are inextricably linked, as this article argued. In light of these findings, the article applied a framework of five AI ethics principles to consider ways in which policymakers could better incorporate AIED’s implications. Finally, the article offered recommendations for AIED scholars on strategies for engagement with the policymaking process, and for performing ethics and policy-oriented AIED research to that end, in order to shape policy deliberations on behalf of the public good.
