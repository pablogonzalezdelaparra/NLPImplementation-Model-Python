Artificial intelligence had become a necessary component for both production and service systems in recent years, as technology had become a vital aspect of daily life. Automated driving vehicles operated autonomously, also known as driverless cars that could operate without a human driver. Research on autonomous vehicles had substantially advanced in recent years. Artificially intelligent autonomous vehicles were the current need of society. Although some people might be apprehensive about giving a computer control of their vehicle, automated driving technologies had the potential to make roads safer. Self-driving automobiles could address environmental issues as well as safety-related ones. Unlike humans, computers did not really have difficulty keeping attention when driving. Additionally, by responding appropriately, an automated car could prevent accidents to potentially dangerous events on the road. Self-driving technology had many advantages, one of which would make more easily accessible means of transport to people who were unable to drive. For a variety of reasons, such as inexperience, incapacity, or age, many people were unable to operate a vehicle. These individuals could travel considerably more safely and independently. Therefore, we would explore the architectures of both software and hardware of autonomous cars in this chapter, as well as their parts, benefits, and future developments.
