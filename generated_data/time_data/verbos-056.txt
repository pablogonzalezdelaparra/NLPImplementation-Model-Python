INTRODUCTION: In recent years, there had been a convergence between Artificial Intelligence and neuroscience, particularly in studying the brain and developing treatments for neurological disorders. Artificial neural networks and deep learning provided valuable insights into neural processing and brain functioning. Recent research tried to explain how neural processes influenced an individual's happiness. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the interaction between neuroscience and happiness based on the advances in Artificial Intelligence. METHODS: A bibliometric analysis was performed with articles from the Scopus database in 2013-2023; likewise, the VOSviewer was used for information processing. RESULTS A total of 603 articles were obtained, and it was evident that the most significant scientific production was centered in the United States (184), United Kingdom (74), and China (73). Three clusters were generated from the Co-occurrence - Author Keywords analysis. The first cluster, red, was related to Artificial Intelligence applications for predicting happiness; the second cluster, green, was associated with Artificial Intelligence tools in neuroscience; and the third cluster, blue, was related to neuroscience in psychology. CONCLUSION: Neuroscience research has made significant leaps in understanding mental processes such as emotions and consciousness. Neuroscience had encountered happiness and was opening up to an approach that seeks evidence to understand people's well-being supported by Artificial Intelligence.
