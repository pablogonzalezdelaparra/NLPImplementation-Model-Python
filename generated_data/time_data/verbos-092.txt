Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) was a pronounced empirical search algorithm for agent decision-making, especially when enhanced by Deep Learning (DL), in mastering board games that were once thought to be unconquerable. However, it did not appear to be as equally successful in the domain of real-time video games, where the simulation time limit for exploration was a crucial factor, since they were generally designed to be played by human users and hence required a significant amount of resources for simulation. We in this paper proposed a surrogate-assisted MCTS approach, specifically targeting commercial real-time video games by approximating the result of gameplay with a deep-learning-based surrogate model. The key contribution of our work was that we designed a modified MCTS for video games that were both commercial and processed in real-time. Since commercial video games included considerably more complex and dynamic gameplays to satisfy their market consumers, as opposed to their non-commercial analogs, our work could be regarded as having challenged the domain unattempted by precedent studies. We validated the performance of our method by conducting a comparative experiment with other algorithms, including the traditional MCTS, under the environment of a commercial real-time video game.
