The metaverse had emerged as an exciting new paradigm for human-computer interaction (HCI) and virtual collaboration. This paper presented a comprehensive review of the metaverse to address the gap in the existing literature where there was a lack of a survey that reviewed the nature of the metaverse and its building blocks from a human-centric perspective. We first synthesized a definition of the metaverse from existing literature and delineated key affordances. We then introduced a detailed framework encompassing the metaverse's nature, infrastructure technologies, and input/output technologies that facilitated multi-sensory HCI, alongside applications across diverse domains. The components within this framework were explained in depth, offering insights into the metaverse's nature and the readiness level of current technologies. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we outlined major open challenges and proposed promising directions demanding further exploration and investigation. By clarifying the vision for the metaverse and characterizing the building blocks required to realize it, this review provided essential insights and served as an invaluable resource for metaverse developers and researchers working to advance this transformative new medium.
