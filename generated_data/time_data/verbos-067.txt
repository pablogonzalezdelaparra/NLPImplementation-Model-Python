The impressive capabilities of living organisms arose from the way autonomy was materialized by their bodies. Across scales, living beings coupled computational or cognitive intelligence with physical intelligence through body morphology, material multifunctionality, and mechanical compliance. While soft robotics had advanced the design and fabrication of physically intelligent bodies, the integration of information-processing capabilities for computational intelligence remained a challenge. Consequently, perception and control limitations had constrained how soft robots were built today. Progress toward untethered autonomy would require deliberate convergence in how the field codeveloped new materials, fabrication methods, and control strategies for soft robots. Here, a new perspective was put forward: that researchers should use tasks alone to impose material and information constraints on soft robot design. A conceptual framework was proposed for a task-first design paradigm that sidestepped limitations imposed by control strategies. This framework allowed emergent synergies between material and information processing properties of soft matter to be readily exploited for task-capable agents. Particular attention was paid to the scale dependence of solutions. Finally, an outlook was presented on emerging research opportunities for achieving autonomy in future soft robots as large as elephant trunks and as small as paramecia.
