Fuzzy logic-based quantification of usability expectation for an m-commerce mobile application was a process of measuring the usability of a mobile application by using fuzzy logic principles. The usability of any mobile application was used to find out the user experience of the mobile application by analyzing the user's expectations and preferences. Fuzzy logic always was the optimal choice for quantification. Fuzzy logic-based quantification of usability expectation assessed the user experience of an m-commerce mobile application by taking into account the user's needs, preferences, and expectations. Usability expectation also took into account the ability of the user to understand and interact with the application, the degree to which the application met the user's expectations, and the overall satisfaction with the application. This process helped to identify areas of improvement, enabling the developers to make necessary changes for a better user experience. This study presented to design of a usability metric framework and then quantified the overall usability quality of an m-commerce mobile application with the help of fuzzy logic. The proposed usability metric framework was based on the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach and was intended to provide a comprehensive and systematic approach to design metrics to assess the qualitative aspect of mobile phone applications. The framework had been developed and tested in an m-commerce context and provided a set of measurable criteria to quantify m-commerce mobile applications as per standard. The results of the evaluation could then be used to improve m-commerce mobile applications and to ensure that the user experience was optimized.
