Empathy is a specific moral aspect of human behavior. The global workplace, and thereby a consideration of employee stakeholders, includes unique behavioral and ethical considerations, including a consideration of human empathy. Further, the human aspects of workplaces are within the domain of human resources and managerial oversight in business organizations. As such, human emotions and interactions are complicated by daily work-related expectations, employee/employer interactions and work practices, and the outcomes of employeesâ€™ work routines. Business ethics, human resources, and risk management practices are endemic aspects within workplaces. Increasingly, the understanding of models of AI-reliant business practices underscored the need for the consideration of the ethical aspects of AI impacts on employees in the workplace. This paper explored a systematic ethical lens of the opportunities and the risks of AI ideation, development, and deployment in business-employee relations practices beyond a compliance mindset, and that introduced a further set of workplace considerations. Empathy was concerned with human intentions. As such, attributive ethical indications of the role of AI in the workplace and its impacts on employees were necessary. Moreover, this paper used a cognitive lens of empathy and focused on artificial morality related to the ethical concerns, implications, and practices of AI development, deployment, and workplace practices that may impact employees in a variety of business aspects.
