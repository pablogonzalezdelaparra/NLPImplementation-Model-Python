Fuzzy inference systems (FISs) had been developed for many years but the use of FISs for high-dimensional problems was still a challenging task. The most frequently used T-norms for computing the firing strengths were product and minimum operators, of which the former was often preferred because of its differentiability. However, for high-dimensional problems, the product T-norm suffered from the numeric underflow problem. Here, we primarily focused on addressing the problem that was associated with the use of the T-norms for designing high-dimensional FISs (HDFISs). For the product T-norm, we constructed an HDFIS named HDFIS-prod, which easily escaped from the numeric underflow problem. The main novelty was that we proposed an adaptive dimension-dependent membership function (DMF). For the minimum T-norm, an empirical observation led us to develop a mechanism that had the natural ability to deal with super high-dimensional problems, which resulted in another HDFIS named HDFIS-min. Both HDFIS-prod and HDFIS-min were tested on 18 datasets with feature dimensions varying from 1024 to 120450. The simulation results demonstrated that both of them had competitive performance on handling high-dimensional datasets.
