Facial recognition was a well-established and popular field in Computer Vision, especially with advancements in deep learning and datasets. Deep facial recognition had made significant progress and was widely applied in real-world scenarios. A complete facial recognition system involved three main components: facial recognition, orientation, and representation. This system detected faces, aligned them to a standard view, and extracted features for recognition using deep convolutional neural networks. This article provided a detailed overview of the latest advancements in these areas, showing how deep learning had greatly enhanced their abilities. Object detection in machine vision was a challenging area that required significant improvements. While image classification accuracy was nearing 2.25%, surpassing human performance, object detection algorithms were still in the early stages. Current algorithms achieved only 40.8 MAPS on modern objects, so careful dataset selection was crucial for optimal results.
