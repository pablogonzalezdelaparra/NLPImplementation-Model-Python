Artificial Intelligence (AI) was reshaping the world in profound ways; some of its impacts were certainly beneficial but widespread and lasting harms could result from the technology as well. The integration of AI into various aspects of human life was underway, and the complex ethical concerns emerging from the design, deployment, and use of the technology served as a reminder that it was time to revisit what future developers and designers, along with professionals, were learning when it came to AI. It was of paramount importance to train future members of the AI community, and other stakeholders as well, to reflect on the ways in which AI might impact peopleâ€™s lives and to embrace their responsibilities to enhance its benefits while mitigating its potential harms. This could occur in part through the fuller and more systematic inclusion of AI ethics into the curriculum. In this paper, we briefly described different approaches to AI ethics and offered a set of recommendations related to AI ethics pedagogy.
