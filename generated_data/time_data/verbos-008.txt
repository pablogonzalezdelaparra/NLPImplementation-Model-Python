In light of fast-growing popular, political, and professional discourses around AI in education, this article outlined five broad areas of contention that merited closer attention in future discussion and decision-making. These included: (1) taking care to focus on issues relating to 'actually existing' AI rather than the overselling of speculative AI technologies; (2) clearly foregrounding the limitations of AI in terms of modeling social contexts, and simulating human intelligence, reckoning, autonomy, and emotions; (3) foregrounding the social harms associated with AI use; (4) acknowledging the value-driven nature of claims around AI; and (5) paying closer attention to the environmental and ecological sustainability of continued AI development and implementation. Thus, in contrast to popular notions of AI as a neutral tool, the argument was made for engaging with the ongoing use of AI in education as a political action that had varying impacts on different groups of people in various educational contexts.
