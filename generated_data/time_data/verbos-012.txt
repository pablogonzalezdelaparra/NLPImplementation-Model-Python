The way healthcare was provided could be completely changed by the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV). AI-enhanced computer vision could be applied to medical picture analysis, disease detection, patient health monitoring, surgical assistance, drug discovery acceleration, and the creation of individualized treatment programs. Improved diagnosis, lower costs, personalized treatment, better patient outcomes, and quicker drug discovery were all advantages of employing AI-assisted computer vision in healthcare. However, the application of these technologies also presented difficulties in terms of data privacy, bias, and legal matters. The sorts of computer vision utilized in healthcare systems were discussed in this chapter, including medical image analysis, disease diagnosis, movement and gait analysis, surgical support, behavioral analysis, and medication discovery. The difficulties of employing computer vision in healthcare were also covered in the chapter, including data privacy concerns, bias, legal concerns, a lack of accessibility, and the complexity of biological systems. Overall, AI-assisted computer vision held immense promise for revolutionizing healthcare systems by enabling quicker and more accurate diagnosis, enhancing patient outcomes, and cutting costs. To make sure that these technologies were used in an ethical and responsible manner, it was crucial to address the issues related to them.
