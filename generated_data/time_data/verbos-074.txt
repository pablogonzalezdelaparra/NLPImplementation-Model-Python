The performance of photovoltaic (PV) was affected directly by climatic changes. The controller maintained maximum potential energy conversion to operate the pumping system at nominal conditions. Fuzzy logic intelligent controllers were successfully suitable and applicable in engineering and applied science. The aim of this paper was to present an experimental approach in the implementation of fuzzy logic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) with a boost converter based on an Arduino Mega micro-controller to maximize energy production in different weather conditions applied to a small-scale pumping system for water and chemical fluid analyses in isolated areas. The system was supplied by a 20 (W) solar photovoltaic (PV) panel. This paper presented a real-time MATLAB/Simulink fuzzy logic method controlling and monitoring MPPT application using a low-cost Arduino Mega micro-controller combined with (LV25, LP55) sensors controlling a boost converter interconnected with a solar panel and plastic pump.
