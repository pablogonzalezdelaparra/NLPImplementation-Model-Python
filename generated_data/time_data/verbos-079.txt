The main idea of this paper was the substantiation of the methodological approach to the assessment of personnel risks of enterprises based on the application of the fuzzy logic apparatus in order to identify the problems of personnel risk management and provide appropriate recommendations for their solution. The methodological basis of the study has been the classic provisions and fundamental works of foreign and domestic scientists, statistical data, the results of our research into the problems of assessing personnel risks of enterprises. The methods of fuzzy set theory, comparative analysis, scientific abstraction, generalization of scientific experience of modern theoretical research, system complex approach were used. The study proposed a methodological approach to assessing the level of personnel risks of an enterprise; numerical experiments were conducted on the basis of a group of construction equipment manufacturers. Analysis of the results of assessing the level of personnel risks of enterprises makes it possible to identify the problems of managing personnel risks at enterprises Statement of a mathematical problem: the work considered hierarchical fuzzy data, namely: four groups of indicators for assessing the level of personnel risks (quantitative composition – F1, state of qualifications and intellectual potential – F2, staff turnover – F3, motivational system – F4), each of the indicators had a different number of fuzzy coefficients (there were twelve of them in the current work – vi , i=1÷12). Indicators were functions of fuzzy coefficients: F1 = r(v1, v2, v3); F2 = g(v4,v5, v6, v7); F3 = h(v8, v9, v10,); F4=q(v11, v12). As an output variable, there was a functional – an integrated indicator Int = f(F1, F2, F3, F4) of the personnel risk level, which, in turn, was also a fuzzy value. Here, the functions r, g, h, q, f were unknown functions of the given variables. We had expert evaluations of the change in all input data; as a rule, they varied within three terms: Low (I), Medium (G), High (E). Formalized information on each variable could be written as , then for a group of indicators we had: . Using a fuzzy system and performing calculations with its help required the system to have the following structural elements: membership functions of input and output variables, a rule base, and an output mechanism. These structural elements have been the components that were built when designing a fuzzy system. The built mathematical model and the method of its formalization on the basis of FST made it possible to estimate the level of personnel risk at the enterprise, which enabled further substantiation of a set of measures to increase the efficiency of its use. The constructed system of fuzzy logical inference could be considered intelligent as it used elements of computational intelligence, in particular, the theory of fuzzy sets. The proposed methodological approach to assessing the level of personnel risks of enterprises based on the apparatus of fuzzy logic allowed, in contrast to existing ones, to integrate the consideration of both qualitative and quantitative indicators when assessing the level of personnel risks and personnel movement indicators and to significantly increase the efficiency of decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and reduce costs in the event of adverse situations.
