Segmentation of tumors in ultrasound (US) images of the breast is a critical issue in medical imaging. Due to the poor quality of US images and the varying specifications of US machines, segmentation and classification of abnormalities presented difficulties even for trained radiologists. The paper aimed to introduce a novel AI-based hybrid model for US segmentation that offered high accuracy, required relatively smaller datasets, and was capable of handling previously unseen data. The software could be used for diagnostics and the US-guided biopsies. A unique and robust hybrid approach that combined deep learning (DL) and multi-agent artificial life (AL) had been introduced. The algorithms were verified on three US datasets. The method outperformed 14 selected state-of-the-art algorithms applied to US images characterized by complex geometry and high level of noise. The paper offered an original classification of the images and tests to analyze the limits of the DL. The model had been trained and verified on 1264 ultrasound images. The images were in the JPEG and PNG formats. The age of the patients ranged from 22 to 73 years. The 14 benchmark algorithms included deformable shapes, edge linking, superpixels, machine learning, and DL methods. The tests used eight-region shape- and contour-based evaluation metrics. The proposed method (DL-AL) produced excellent results in terms of the dice coefficient (region) and the relative Hausdorff distance H3 (contour-based) as followed: the easiest image complexity level, Dice = 0.96 and H3 = 0.26; the medium complexity level, Dice = 0.91 and H3 = 0.82; and the hardest complexity level, Dice = 0.90 and H3 = 0.84. All other metrics followed the same pattern. The DL-AL outperformed the second best (Unet-based) method by 10–20%. The method had been also tested by a series of unconventional tests. The model was trained on low complexity images and applied to the entire set of images. These results were summarized below. (1) Only the low complexity images had been used for training (68% unknown images): Dice = 0.80 and H3 = 2.01. (2) The low and the medium complexity images had been used for training (51% unknown images): Dice = 0.86 and H3 = 1.32. (3) The low, medium, and hard complexity images had been used for training (35% unknown images): Dice = 0.92 and H3 = 0.76. These tests showed a significant advantage of DL-AL over 30%
