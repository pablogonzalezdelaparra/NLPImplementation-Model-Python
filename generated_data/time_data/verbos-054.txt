This paper introduced a study employing artificial intelligence (AI) to utilize computer vision algorithms for detecting human emotions in video content during user interactions with diverse visual stimuli. The research aimed to unveil the creation of software capable of emotion detection by leveraging AI algorithms and image processing pipelines to identify users' facial expressions. The process involved assessing users through images and facilitating the implementation of computer vision algorithms aligned with psychological theories defining emotions and their recognizable features. The study demonstrated the feasibility of emotion recognition through convolutional neural networks (CNN) and software development and training based on facial expressions. The results highlighted successful emotion identification; however, precision improvement necessitated further training for contexts with more diverse images and additional algorithms to distinguish closely related emotional patterns. The discussion and conclusions emphasized the potential of AI and computer vision algorithms in emotion detection, providing insights into software development, ongoing training, and the evolving landscape of emotion recognition technology. Further training was necessary for contexts with more diverse images, alongside additional algorithms that could effectively distinguish between facial expressions depicting closely related emotional patterns, enhancing certainty and accuracy.
