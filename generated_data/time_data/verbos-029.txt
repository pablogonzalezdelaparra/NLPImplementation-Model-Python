Face recognition had a very important role in various applications, from security, surveillance to authentication. For safety, most households were having CC cameras such that they could recognize the persons from it. These CCTV cameras were allocated for having safety and to know who visited their houses. In a few highly secured places, allowance to any unknown intruder was strictly prohibited. Thereby, this paper dealt with a system which could recognize the face of the intruder through a surveillance camera using ML and AI-based algorithms. The design specified was successfully implemented using HOG feature extraction and SVM classification algorithms, and it classified the faces for a video stream given as input. The major objective entitled to this paper was to recognize the faces of people from the video by HOG feature extractor and classify them using SVM, and train the machine to tell who was the person working for the organization and who were the intruders.
