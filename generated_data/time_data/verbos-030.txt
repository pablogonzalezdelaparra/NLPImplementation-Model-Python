The growing population also led to a growing consumer base which increased the load and resources to cater to the needs of the day-by-day increasing consumers. Just as technology was being used to solve all the problems, so why not this one. The idea was to make a more convenient and advanced supermarket experience, where there were no cashiers or lines so that we could shop hassle-free. This project implemented Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things to automate a supermarket for better efficiency. A person just needed to walk in after scanning their QR code through the app with their unique ID on it. It recorded the customer's presence in the shop. The shopping carts and baskets had sensors on them, which could detect the product entering or being taken out. The products were placed on shelves which had pressure sensors to detect if any product was picked up. These shelves were closed and they only opened with your shopping cards. When you reached the counter, you only had to swipe your card again and money would be deducted from your account according to your purchase and a receipt would be given. We looked forward to providing this technology to various supermarket chains in the country and abroad and help them implement it with a nominal one-time investment.
