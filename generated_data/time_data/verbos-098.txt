Serious video games provided a immersive learning environment for agriculture by simulating real-life challenges scenarios. However, empirical evidence of their effectiveness was sparse. This scoping review followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines to summarize literature on serious video games for agricultural learning, highlighted research trends and identified gaps. We systematically searched nine prominent research databases for papers on serious video games for agriculture learning published between January 2000 and July 2022. Two independent reviewers conducted screening, data extraction, and synthesized the collected data using a narrative approach. The initial search identified 3,297 articles, of which 0.58% ( n = 19) were included in the review. Most reviewed games had been released in the last five years, with a predominant presence in the mobile platform. They commonly employed a simulation-based approach, featured 2-D graphics and designed for single-player experiences. These games mainly targeted students, focusing on crop production and sustainable agriculture. Educational theories were often unspecified in the studies. Evaluation protocols primarily consisted of pilot studies, emphasized user experience and knowledge enhancement. Positive outcomes, such as improved user experiences, knowledge, and attitude and behavior changes, were commonly observed in these studies. This study highlighted advancements in using serious video games for agricultural learning over 20 years. However, it stressed the need for deeper exploration of game elements' impact on user experience and effectiveness. Creating games for underrepresented players and specific agricultural challenges was essential, as was enhancing theoretical foundations and learning approaches. Rigorous research designs were vital for assessing game effectiveness across short, medium, and long terms.
