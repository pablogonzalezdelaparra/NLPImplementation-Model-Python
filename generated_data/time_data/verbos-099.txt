With the development of education and technology, teachers gradually realize that games should not be just a way for students to entertain themselves. Applying games to teaching resources could achieve better teaching outcomes. However, related resources were constantly emerging on the internet. To achieve higher quality recommendations, a personalized recommendation model for educational video game resources based on knowledge graphs was proposed. Firstly, feature extraction was performed alternately on the user side and the item side. Then a hidden Markov model was introduced on the basis of the dual end neighbor algorithm. Considering the temporal nature of the user, the model was optimized. The optimized model took into account the long-term and short-term preferences of users and mined their potential preferences. Through experimental analysis, the hit rate index value of the designed model reached 0.7989. The normalized cumulative gain value of the broken line was 0.6045. More than 89% of users were satisfied with the recommendation of this model. The running time was 0.2863s. The constructed model could achieve efficient and high-quality recommendation of educational video game resources, providing users with a more convenient and efficient online experience.
