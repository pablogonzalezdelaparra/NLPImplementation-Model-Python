This study was conducted to investigate the empathy between human-chatbot interactions among computer science students at Uppsala University, Sweden. This was done by exploring how participants perceived anthropomorphic chatbots as machines or humans, the existence of verbal abuse during human-chatbot interactions, and the expectation of chatbot helpfulness depending on gender dynamics. A semi-structured interview methodology with five students was conducted for qualitative data collection. The collected data was manually analyzed using thematic analysis. The results of this study found that there was empathy in human-chatbot interaction, regardless of whether participants perceived anthropomorphic chatbots as humans or machines. However, the level of empathy was generally low as participants frustrated when they were dissatisfied with the response of chatbots and exited the chatbots without expressing their frustration, and they usually forgot their frustration and came again with other questions another time. The study also showed that participants might expect more help and politeness if chatbots were more likely to be female.
