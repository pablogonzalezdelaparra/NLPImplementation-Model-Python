Machine learning (ML) was a form of artificial intelligence which was placed to transform the twenty-first century. Rapid, recent progress in its underlying architecture and algorithms and growth in the size of datasets had led to increasing computer competence across a range of fields. These included driving a vehicle, language translation, chatbots and beyond human performance at complex board games such as Go. Here, we reviewed the fundamentals and algorithms behind machine learning and highlighted specific approaches to learning and optimisation. We then summarised the applications of ML to medicine. In particular, we showcased recent diagnostic performances, and caveats, in the fields of dermatology, radiology, pathology and general microscopy.
