In recent years, with the continuous progress and development of science and technology, especially the continuous development of artificial intelligence, machine algorithm and other technologies, the education system had also begun to carry out more personalized content from traditional functions. Traditional education systems often adopted a one-size-fits-all approach to teaching that did not take into account the unique needs and learning styles of each student. An education system personalized and optimized by machine learning algorithms could provide customized learning materials and recommendations based on each student's learning history, interests, and abilities to improve learning outcomes, and machine learning algorithms could provide real-time feedback on student performance and adjust learning plans based on feedback. This made the learning process more dynamic and personalized. It could therefore be applied to all types of education, including language learning, mathematics, science, etc. However, improving the efficiency of machine learning algorithms depended more on the improvement of numerical optimization algorithms, so it was necessary to summarize the optimization algorithms in large-scale machine learning. This paper tried to make a detailed overview of the existing machine learning algorithms in optimizing personalized education recommendation systems, and introduced the algorithm optimization process.
