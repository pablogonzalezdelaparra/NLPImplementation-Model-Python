This paper firstly researched English text emotion expression and information communication, classified English text emotion expression and information communication according to the human emotion-value relationship, and summarized the characteristics of English emotion expression and information communication. Secondly, using artificial intelligence technology, it was proposed to construct an analysis model for English text emotion and information communication using the BiLSTM neural network. To deal with the characteristics of English text quickly and efficiently, it was necessary to encode the emotional information of English text, and based on encoding, the BiLSTM neural network was applied to extract the emotional features of English text and solve the problem of the loss of emotional features through the loss function. Then, the crawler tool was used to obtain the dataset from the Chinese English module under the MOOC of Chinese universities, and the evaluation indexes were set according to the modelâ€™s performance, followed by the experimental analysis of the English text emotion expression and information conveyance. The results showed that compared with the original CNN, LSTM, and T-LSTM, the BiLSTM-based neural network performed better in the task of text emotion expression and information conveyance, with the accuracy rate staying above 0.925, and the effect on the English dataset was a bit better than that on the Chinese dataset. This study aimed to enhance English teaching and communication between Chinese and foreign cultures.
