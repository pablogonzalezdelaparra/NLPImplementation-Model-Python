Given the challenges of inter-domain information fusion and data sparsity in collaborative filtering algorithms, this paper proposed a cross-domain information fusion matrix decomposition algorithm to enhance the accuracy of personalized recommendations in artificial intelligence recommendation systems. The study began by collecting Douban movie rating data and social network information. To ensure data integrity, Levenshtein distance detection was employed to remove duplicate scores, while natural language processing technology was utilized to extract keywords and topic information from social texts. Additionally, graph convolutional networks have been utilized to convert user relationships into feature vectors, and a unique thermal coding method was used to convert discrete user and movie information into binary matrices. To prevent overfitting, the Ridge regularization method was introduced to gradually optimize potential feature vectors. Weighted average and feature connection techniques were then applied to integrate features from different fields. Moreover, the paper combined the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm with merged user characteristics to generate personalized recommendation lists. In the experimental stage, the paper conducted cross-domain information fusion optimization on four mainstream mathematical matrix decomposition algorithms: alternating least squares method, non-negative matrix decomposition, singular value decomposition, and latent factor model (LFM). It compared these algorithms with the non-fused approach. The results indicated a significant improvement in score accuracy, with mean absolute error and root mean squared error reduced by 12.8% and 13.2% respectively across the four algorithms. Additionally, when k = 10, the average F1 score reached 0.97, and the ranking accuracy coverage of the LFM algorithm increased by 54.2%. Overall, the mathematical matrix decomposition algorithm combined with cross-domain information fusion demonstrated clear advantages in accuracy, prediction performance, recommendation diversity, and ranking quality, and improved the accuracy and diversity of the recommendation system. By effectively addressing collaborative filtering challenges through the integration of diverse techniques, it significantly surpassed traditional models in recommendation accuracy and variety.
