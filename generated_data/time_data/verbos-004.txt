Method: A narrative synthesis and a systematic literature review are conducted in this review article. The literature and information are obtained from various books and research articles on EBSCO, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect. The inclusion criteria are studies that clearly define artificial intelligence in the education sector, are published and written in English and are peer-reviewed. Five independent reviewers assess search results, extract data, and set the studiesâ€™ quality to summarize and report the findings.

Result: Artificial intelligence had already entered the education sector. Implementing artificial intelligence was a strategic and critical factor in educational development. Furthermore, artificial intelligence was increasingly used as a digital assistant. They assisted teachers and students in various ways, including giving students access to a wide range of learning materials based on their specific learning needs and subjects. However, some risks were associated with artificial intelligence advancements, such as safety, security, and privacy concerns. As a result, artificial intelligence technologies positively and negatively affected the education sector.

Conclusion: Artificial intelligence technologies had positive and negative effects on education. Thus, it was critical to prioritize artificial intelligence in education and implement appropriate strategies to meet teachers' and students' needs and expectations through AI technologies. As a result, academic performance was excellent.

Recommendation & Implication: Qualitative research, such as interviews, or quantitative analysis, such as online questionnaires, might be developed in the future to provide more explanations and explicit findings. The implications could be applied to school administrators, teachers, and students to understand better and implement appropriate strategies to improve educational performance through AI.
