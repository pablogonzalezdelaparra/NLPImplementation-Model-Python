The future of autonomous vehicles lay in the convergence of human-centric design and advanced AI capabilities. Autonomous vehicles of the future would not only transport passengers but also interact and adapt to their desires, making the journey comfortable, efficient, and pleasant. In this paper, we presented a novel framework that leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance autonomous vehicles' decision-making processes. By integrating LLMs' natural language capabilities and contextual understanding, specialized tools usage, synergizing reasoning, and acting with various modules on autonomous vehicles, this framework aimed to seamlessly integrate the advanced language and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into autonomous vehicles. The proposed framework held the potential to revolutionize the way autonomous vehicles operated, offering personalized assistance, continuous learning, and transparent decision-making, ultimately contributing to safer and more efficient autonomous driving technologies.
