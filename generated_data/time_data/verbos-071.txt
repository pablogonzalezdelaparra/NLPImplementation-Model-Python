Fuzzy logic emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing power flow solutions, particularly in the context of deregulated power systems. By employing fuzzy logic controls, the ideal placement of distribution generators (DGs) could be determined, ensuring the reliability indices were identified through optimal power flow solutions and fuzzy logic controllers to maintain system feasibility. In a deregulated power system, strategic placement of distribution generator units played a crucial role in minimizing power loss and enhancing overall system performance by mitigating fluctuations. To identify areas of weakness, especially within transmission companies, accessing optimal power flow algorithms became essential in a deregulated power system. Both transmission and distribution networks should be appropriately adjusted to alleviate congestion within the respective companies. The aggregator had to assess system performance, utilizing data obtained from distribution and transmission companies within the deregulated power system.
