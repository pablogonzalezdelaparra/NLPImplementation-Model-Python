This work reported an experience in using an Artificial Life competitive game that simulated an artificial life environment for unstructured and informal Artificial Intelligence (AI) teaching to students from computer science engineering careers. The game consisted of a simulated Petri dish where two colonies of microorganisms-software agents-must struggle to survive. To achieve this goal, the participants had to implement surviving strategies for their agents, which included fighting strategies and basic reproduction rules to prevail over all the artificial environment. The technical bases of the contest as well as a description of the artificial life model were explained in detail. The pedagogical experience acquired in the contest development was discussed, as well as the resulting learning experience, which generated students' enthusiasm and had helped them to develop mental models of possible AI algorithms.
