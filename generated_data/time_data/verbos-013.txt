Agriculture was the ultimate imperative and primary source of origin to furnish domestic income for multifarious countries. The disease caused in plants due to various pathogens like viruses, fungi, and bacteria was liable for considerable monetary losses in the agriculture corporation across the world. The security of crops concerning quality and quantity was crucial to monitor disease in plants. Thus, recognition of plant disease was essential. The plant disease syndrome was noticeable in distinct parts of plants. Nonetheless, commonly the infection was detected in distinct leaves of plants. Computer vision, deep learning, few-shot learning, and soft computing techniques were utilized by various investigators to automatically identify the disease in plants via leaf images. These techniques also benefited farmers in achieving expeditious and appropriate actions to avoid a reduction in the quality and quantity of crops. The application of these techniques in the recognition of disease could avert the disadvantage of origin by a factious selection of disease features, extraction of features, and boost the speed of technology and efficiency of research. Also, certain molecular techniques had been established to prevent and mitigate the pathogenic threat. Hence, this review helped the investigator to automatically detect disease in plants using machine learning, deep learning, and few-shot learning and provided certain diagnosis techniques to prevent disease. Moreover, some of the future works in the classification of disease were also discussed.
