This article examined a solution to the major problems of induction machine control in order to achieve superior dynamic performance. Conventional direct torque control and indirect control with flux orientation had some drawbacks, such as current harmonics, torque ripples, flux ripples, and rise time. In this article, we proposed a comparative analysis between previous approaches and the one using fuzzy logic. Results from the simulation showed that the direct torque control method using fuzzy logic was more effective in providing a precise and fast response without overshooting, and it eliminated torque and flux fluctuations at low switching frequencies. The demonstrated improvements in dynamic performance contributed to increased operational efficiency and reliability in industrial applications.
