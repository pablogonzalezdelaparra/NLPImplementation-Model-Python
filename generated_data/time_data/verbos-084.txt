Smart cities represented the convergence of information and communication technologies (ICT) with urban management to improve the quality of life of city dwellers. In this context, recommender systems, tools that offered personalized suggestions to city dwellers, emerged as key contributors to this convergence. Their successful application in various areas of city life and their ability to process massive amounts of data generated in urban environments had expedited their status as a crucial technology in the evolution of city planning. Our methodology included reviewing the Web of Science database, resulting in 130 articles that, filtered for relevancy, were reduced to 86. The first stage consisted of carrying out a bibliometric analysis with the objective of analyzing structural aspects with the SciMAT tool. Secondly, a systematic literature review was undertaken using the PRISMA 2020 statement. The results illustrated the different processes by which recommendations were filtered in areas such as tourism, health, mobility, and transport. This research was seen as a significant breakthrough that could drive the evolution and efficiency of smart cities, establishing a solid framework for future research in this dynamic field.
