The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) was significantly increasing in many Human Resources (HR) functions. This research aimed to understand how diverse experts from distinct organizations, such as Project Managers, Managers, Supervisors, and Human Resource Managers, perceived the potential of artificial intelligence-based recommender systems to match job profiles with employee profiles. This study employed a Delphi study-based methodology specifically, organizing an expert panel that provided their opinions through their ratings and comments on a set of propositions. Based on the online Delphi study results and participant opinions, this research aimed to identify the challenges related to employee-job profile matching through artificial intelligence and machine learning tools in the form of recommender systems. In this study, we delved into the various challenges of matching employee profiles to job profiles and the current problems faced by executives, human resource personnel, or supervisors such as project managers in an organization. The study also shed light on the potential or feasibility solutions of artificial intelligence in the form of recommender systems where we also tested a couple of propositions that focused on potential solutions and various challenges for matching employee profiles to job profiles in an organization.
