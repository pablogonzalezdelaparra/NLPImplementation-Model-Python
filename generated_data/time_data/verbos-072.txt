In this article, the causes of technological disturbances in electrical systems were considered, and several characteristic disadvantages of the protection and automation of elements of electrical systems were highlighted. The tendency to decrease the reliability of relay protection associated with the transition from analog to digital types of protection was substantiated. Based on the studied examples, the use of fuzzy logic in protections, the expediency of using fuzzy logic elements in protection devices, and the automation of electrical systems to identify types of short circuits were justified. This article analyzed the most common damages and presented the results of modeling an electrical system with transformer coupling, where all types of asymmetric short circuits have been initiated. The dynamics of changes in the symmetrical components of short-circuit currents of the forward, reverse, and zero sequences were determined. Rules had been created for the identification of asymmetric types of short circuits. An algorithm of protection and automation operation using fuzzy logic elements had been developed. The proposed algorithm of protection and automation would reduce the time to determine the type of damage and trigger protections.
