This article delved into the intricacies of adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control for nonholonomic multirobot systems characterized by infinite actuator faults and range constraints. To address these issues, we leveraged the power of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and employed adaptive methods to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and uncertain parameters present in robotic dynamics. In the course of information exploration, the problems of collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance were ever present due to limitations of distance and visual fields. In this regard, we introduced a general barrier function and prescribed performance methodology to tackle constrained range impediments effectively. Furthermore, to reduce the number of controller executions and compensate for any effect arising from infinite actuator failures, robots engaged with their leader at the moment of actuator faults using fewer network communication resources yet maintained uninterrupted tracking of the desired trajectory generated by the leader. With the aid of the dynamic surface technology, we proposed a decentralized adaptive event-triggering fault-tolerant (ETFT) formation control strategy. We guaranteed that all signals were semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Ultimately, we demonstrated the practical feasibility of the ETFT control strategy for nonholonomic multirobot systems.
