The sphere of artificial intelligence (AI) technology was quite wide. There were many individual and collaborative AI-based technologies available. One of them was computer vision technology. Computer vision was also related to other technologies: Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), artificial neural networks, etc. Computer vision was applied in many different areas. One of the areas where it had been widely applied in recent times was healthcare. In healthcare, various algorithms in the aforementioned technologies were used to obtain meaningful information from medical images. In this chapter, the concept of computer vision, its fields of application, and its application in healthcare were reviewed. Also, the example of tumor detection by computer vision in a MATLAB environment was considered.
