With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, there was an increasing number of industries relying on the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning algorithms. But due to the inexplicability and black box effect of deep neural networks, we could only obtain results without knowing the applied reasoning behind them. That engendered skepticism and resistance from some quarters of deep learning-based technologies. In the context of emotion analysis used in business and public opinion monitoring, it was sometimes difficult for decision-makers to trust the outcome without an explanation from the supposedly emotionless machines. There were mathematical-based explanation methods, and they often generalized emotion analysis as a classification task. Still, emotion should be different from other task categories because the generation of emotion involved human-specific factors and logic. This paper proposed an emotion analysis explanation framework that was grounded in psychological theories focusing on the stimulus from classic emotion theories. This proposed framework emphasized considering the cause and trigger of emotions as the explanation for the deep learning-based emotion analysis, and it included two main components: the extraction of the emotion cause and the visualization of emotion-triggering words.
