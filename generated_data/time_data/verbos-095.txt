International relations scholarship had long emphasized that popular culture could impact public understandings and political realities. In this article, we explored these potentials in the context of military-themed video games and their portrayals of weaponized artificial intelligence (AI). Within paradoxical video game representations of AI weapons both as insurmountable enemies that posed existential threats to humankind in narratives and as easy targets that human protagonists routinely overcame in gameplay, we identified distortions of human-machine interaction that contradicted real-world scenarios. These distortions revolved around video games affording players enhanced human agency to dominate AI weapons to offer enjoyable gameplay, contradicting the same weapons being intended to diminish human agency on real-world battlefields. By leveraging the Actor-Network Theory concept of translation, we explained how these distorted portrayals of AI weapons were produced by entanglements between heterogeneous human and non-human actors that aimed to make video games mass-marketable and profitable. In so doing, we echoed game studies research that called for greater attention to the commercial and ludic dimensions of video games so that international relations scholarship could better account for pop culture's bounded abilities to impact public understandings and political realities.
