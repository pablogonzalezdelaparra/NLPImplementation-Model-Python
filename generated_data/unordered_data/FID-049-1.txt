However, existing research frequently overlooks the multidimensionality of empathy, leading to an insufficient understanding if artificial empathy is perceived similarly to interpersonal empathy. This research thus highlights that empathy does not equally apply to human-bot interactions. This paper argues that implementing experiential expressions of empathy may have unintended negative consequences as they might feel inauthentic. Instead, providing instrumental support could be more suitable for modeling artificial empathy as it aligns better with computer-like schemas towards chatbots. Two experimental studies using healthcare chatbots examine the effect of empathetic (feeling with), sympathetic (feeling for), and behavioral-empathetic (empathetic helping) vs. non-empathetic responses on perceived warmth, perceived authenticity, and their consequences on trust and using intentions. A third study does not replicate this backfiring effect in human-human interactions. As hypothesized, empathetic, and sympathetic responses reduce the chatbot's perceived authenticity suppressing this positive effect in both studies. Results reveal that any kind of empathy (vs. no empathy) enhances perceived warmth resulting in higher trust and using intentions. It further introduces the concept of ‘perceived authenticity’ and demonstrates that distinctively human attributes might backfire by feeling inauthentic in interactions with chatbots. Implementing empathy to healthcare chatbots is considered promising to create a sense of human warmth.
