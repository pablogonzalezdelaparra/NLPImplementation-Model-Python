This was done by exploring how participants perceive anthropomorphic chatbots as machines or humans, the existence of verbal abuse during human chatbot interactions, and the expectation of chatbot helpfulness depending on gender dynamics. This study was conducted to investigate the empathy between human chatbot interactions among computer science students at Uppsala University, Sweden. A semi-structured interview methodology with five students was conducted for qualitative data collection. The collected data was manually analyzed using thematic analysis. The results of this study found that there is empathy in human chatbot interaction, regardless of whether participants perceive anthropomorphic chatbots as humans or machines. However, the level of empathy is generally low as participants frustrate when they are dissatisfied with the response of chatbots and exit the chatbots without expressing their frustration, and they usually forget their frustration and come again with other questions another time. The study also shows that participants might expect more help and politeness if chatbots are more likely to be female.
