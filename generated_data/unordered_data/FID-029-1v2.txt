The products are placed on shelves which have pressure sensors to detect if any product is picked up. Just as technology is being used to solve all the problems so why not this one. The idea is to make a more convenient and advanced super market experience, where there are no cashiers or lines so that we can shop hassle free. A person just needs to walk in after scanning their QR code through the app with their unique ID on it. This project implements Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things to automate a supermarket for better efficiency. It will record the customer's presence in the shop. We look forward to provide this technology to various super market chains in the country and abroad and help them implement it with a nominal one time investment. The growing population also leads to a growing consumer base which increases the load and resources to cater the needs of the day-by-day increasing consumers. The shopping carts and baskets have sensors on them, which can detect the product entering or being taken out. When you reach the counter, you only have swipe your card again and money will be deducted from your account according to your purchase and a receipt will be given. These shelves are closed and they only open with your shopping cards.
