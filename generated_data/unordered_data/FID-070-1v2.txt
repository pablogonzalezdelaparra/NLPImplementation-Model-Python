Fuzzy logic emerges as a powerful tool for optimizing power flow solutions, particularly in the context of deregulated power systems. In a deregulated power system, strategic placement of distribution generator units plays a crucial role in minimizing power loss and enhancing overall system performance by mitigating fluctuations. By employing fuzzy logic controls, the ideal placement of distribution generators (DGs) can be determined, ensuring the reliability indices are identified through optimal power flow solutions and fuzzy logic controllers to maintain system feasibility. To identify areas of weakness, especially within transmission companies, accessing optimal power flow algorithms becomes essential in a deregulated power system. The aggregator must assess system performance, utilizing data obtained from distribution and transmission companies within the deregulated power system. Both transmission and distribution networks should be appropriately adjusted to alleviate congestion within the respective companies.
