Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands as a pivotal innovation deeply ingrained in both our daily routines and industrial operations. AI constantly updates human experiences, shaping interactions and augmenting capabilities. For instance, contemporary educational institutions leverage AI algorithms for attendance tracking via facial recognition technology. Its rapid evolution promises transformative impacts across various sectors, from cutting-edge industries to the lives of ordinary individuals. Looking ahead, the advent of autonomous vehicles represents a pinnacle of AI application, where vehicles rely entirely on AI systems for navigation, detecting traffic signals, and navigating roads.
