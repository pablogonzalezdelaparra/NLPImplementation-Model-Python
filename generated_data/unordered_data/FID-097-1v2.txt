However, it stresses the need for deeper exploration of game elements' impact on user experience and effectiveness. Evaluation protocols primarily consisted of pilot studies, emphasizing user experience and knowledge enhancement. This scoping review follows PRISMA-ScR guidelines to summarize literature on serious video games for agricultural learning, highlighting research trends and identifying gaps. We systematically searched nine prominent research databases for papers on serious video games for agriculture learning published between January 2000 and July 2022. Two independent reviewers conducted screening, data extraction, and synthesized the collected data using a narrative approach. The initial search identified 3,297 articles, of which 0.58% ( n = 19) were included in the review. This study highlights advancements in using serious video games for agricultural learning over 20 years. Positive outcomes, such as improved user experiences, knowledge, and attitude and behavior changes, were commonly observed in these studies. They commonly employed a simulation-based approach, featuring 2-D graphics and designed for single-player experiences. Educational theories were often unspecified in the studies. However, empirical evidence of their effectiveness is sparse. These games mainly target students, focusing on crop production and sustainable agriculture. Most reviewed games were released in the last five years, with a predominant presence in the mobile platform. Serious video games provide a immersive learning environment for agriculture by simulating real-life challenges scenarios. Creating games for underrepresented players and specific agricultural challenges is essential, as is enhancing theoretical foundations and learning approaches. Rigorous research designs are vital for assessing game effectiveness across short, medium, and long terms.
