Recent technological developments have enabled computers to identify and categorize facial expressions to determine a person’s emotional state in an image or a video. This process, called “Facial Expression Recognition (FER)”, has become one of the most popular research areas in computer vision. Thus, the precise segmentation of organs and their lesions may contribute to an efficient diagnostics process and a more effective selection of targeted therapies, as well as increasing the effectiveness of the training process. In this paper, a comprehensive survey is provided on deep FER, encompassing algorithms and datasets that offer insights into these intrinsic problems. Initially, this paper presents a detailed timeline showcasing the evolution of methods and datasets in deep facial expression recognition (FER). This timeline illustrates the progression and development of the techniques and data resources used in FER. The system is equipped with an interactive interface that shows students correct demonstrations of movements and provides real-time feedback and guidance. Then, a comprehensive review of FER methods is introduced, including the basic principles of FER (components such as preprocessing, feature extraction and classification, and methods, etc.) Finally, future lines of research and development directions of artificial intelligence applications, both in medical image segmentation and extended reality-based medical solutions, are discussed. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to design an intelligent auxiliary system using artificial muscle integrated optical equipment to realize real-time monitoring and accurate evaluation of volleyball teaching, so as to assist coaches to accurately guide students’ movement skills. This can develop five-element music therapy. Moreover, a brief introduction is provided related to the benchmark datasets (there are two categories: controlled environments (lab) and uncontrolled environments (in the wild)) used to evaluate different FER methods and a comparison of different FER models. Existing deep neural networks and related training strategies designed for FER, based on static images and dynamic image sequences, are discussed. The remaining challenges and corresponding opportunities in FER and the future directions for designing robust deep FER systems are also pinpointed.
