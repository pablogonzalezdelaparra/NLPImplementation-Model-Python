Fuzzy logic emerges as a powerful tool for optimizing power flow solutions, particularly in the context of deregulated power systems. This study presented the development of an AI Taekwondo performance improvement analysis and evaluation system and a metaverse-based virtual Taekwondo pumsae/fighting coaching platform through an AI-based motion tracking analysis method. By employing fuzzy logic controls, the ideal placement of distribution generators (DGs) can be determined, ensuring the reliability indices are identified through optimal power flow solutions and fuzzy logic controllers to maintain system feasibility. The system is equipped with an interactive interface that shows students correct demonstrations of movements and provides real-time feedback and guidance. To identify areas of weakness, especially within transmission companies, accessing optimal power flow algorithms becomes essential in a deregulated power system. Both transmission and distribution networks should be appropriately adjusted to alleviate congestion within the respective companies. The aggregator must assess system performance, utilizing data obtained from distribution and transmission companies within the deregulated power system.
