The future sustainability of the global automotive industry will be greatly affected by the fourth industrial revolution and the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). The “new normal” is projected to be driven by new industry standards including an increasingly autonomous self-driving technology, amended safety standards, more complex insurance regulations, adaptive social resistance to technological change, city infrastructure requirements with a digital divide, and disruptive business innovation based on strategic input supply partnerships with open-source AI. In this chapter, the key factors of the autonomous vehicles (AVs) are analyzed using AI developments in radar and laser technology, commercial risk factors, self-driving consumer behavior, city infrastructure constraints, and social adaptations to new technology. Through in-depth research, we have designed a music sound recognition system that uses Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) for feature parameter extraction, and combines BP neural network algorithm to construct a music sound learning model. Basketball in particular, has captured the interest of the real-time analytics and data science community.
