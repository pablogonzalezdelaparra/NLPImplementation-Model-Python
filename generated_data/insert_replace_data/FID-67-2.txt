In this paper, Self-Reproduction characteristic of Artificial Life is introduced to computer animation. The sports industry is progressively embracing technological advancements, and artificial intelligence stands out as a prominent innovation. It is noted that, to date, the major limitations of using Midjourney encompass its restriction to only facilitating early fashion design stages and necessitating substantial involvement from designers. Based on Artificial Fish's phenotype, the contents of its chromosome are given. Based on this model, heredity rules are given. Artificial Fish could reproduce and grow in the virtual marine environment freely controlled by the gene model and rules. Our proposed music sound learning model is based on a BP neural network, which trains the network to learn the mapping relationship between music sound and pitch. Artificial behaviors include predefined behaviors and nondeterminate behaviors. Cognitive models based on Artificial Intelligence is put forward and built to control behaviors of artificial fish in high level. We consider different types of neural networks used with a special emphasis on the learning rules applied, taking into account algorithm accuracy and performance, as well as open data availability. These made groundwork to improve the efficiency and automatic level of artificial fish animation.
