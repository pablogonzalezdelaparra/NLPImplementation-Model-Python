Throughout the last decades, the number of vehicles on the road has steadily increased due to the rising demand for urban mobility and contemporary logistics. Two of the many detrimental effects of more vehicles on the road, which also impede economic development, are increased traffic congestion and traffic accidents. The issues mentioned above can be significantly resolved by making vehicles smarter by reducing their reliance on humans. Over the past century, various nations have conducted extensive research that has fueled the automation of road vehicles. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms have revolutionized the medical image segmentation processes. Our results revealed that the area of sports analytics is gaining momentum and AI in the basketball world has more adoption in China, USA, Australia, Canada, Italy and Spain from a research perspective. In order for AVs to perceive their surroundings and make the right decisions in real time, AI has emerged as a crucial component. This development of AI is being driven by the growth of big data from numerous sensing devices and cutting-edge computing resources. Through in-depth research, we have designed a music sound recognition system that uses Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) for feature parameter extraction, and combines BP neural network algorithm to construct a music sound learning model.
