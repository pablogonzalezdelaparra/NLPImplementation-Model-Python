The metaverse has emerged as an exciting new paradigm for human-computer interaction (HCI) and virtual collaboration. Subsequently, the detected text region undergoes line-by-line division through a text segmentation network. We first synthesize a definition of the metaverse from existing literature and delineate key affordances. This paperâ€™s contributions are threefold: (1) the design of a comprehensive, on-site industrial OCR system for autonomous registration of iron plates; (2) the development of a realistic synthetic image generation strategy and a robust data augmentation strategy to address data scarcity; and (3) demonstrated impressive experimental results, indicating potential for on-site industrial applications. We then introduce a detailed framework encompassing the metaverses nature, infrastructure technologies, and input/output technologies that facilitate multi-sensory HCI, alongside applications across diverse domains. The components within this framework are explained in depth, offering insights into the metaverses nature and the readiness level of current technologies. It concludes with possible developments and open challenges in AI applications in extended reality-based solutions. By clarifying the vision for the metaverse and characterizing the building blocks required to realize it, this review provides essential insights and serves as an invaluable resource for metaverse developers and researchers working to advance this transformative new medium.
