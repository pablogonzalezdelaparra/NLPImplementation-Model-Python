This paper navigates artificial intelligences recent advancements and increasing media attention. In the last decade, AI use in Orthopaedics increased approximately tenfold. A notable focus is placed on Eliezer Yudkowsky, a leading figure within the domain of artificial intelligence alignment, who aims to bridge the understanding gap between public perceptions and rationalist viewpoints on artificial intelligence technology. This focus analyzes his predicted course of action for artificial intelligence outlined within his unpublished paper AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities. The experiment used piano sound as an example to verify the accuracy and reliability of the system. This is achieved by attempting to understand the concept of intelligence itself and identifying a reasonable working definition of that concept. The concept of intelligence is then applied to contemporary artificial intelligence capabilities and developments to understand its applicability to the technologies. This paper finds contemporary artificial intelligence systems are, to some extent, intelligent. With the aid of AI, the combination of intelligent technology and on-site teaching solves the lack of individuation in the traditional mode and enhances studentsâ€™ interest in learning. However, it argues that both weak and strong artificial intelligence systems, devoid of human-defined goals, would not inherently pose existential threats to humanity, challenging the notions of artificial intelligence alignment, bringing into question the validity of Nick Bostroms Orthogonality Thesis. Our results revealed that the area of sports analytics is gaining momentum and AI in the basketball world has more adoption in China, USA, Australia, Canada, Italy and Spain from a research perspective. Furthermore, the possibility of artificial life created through the method of assembling various modules each emulating a separate mind function is discussed.
