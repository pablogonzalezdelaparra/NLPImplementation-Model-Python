In this paper, Self-Reproduction characteristic of Artificial Life is introduced to computer animation. Here, we discussed the challenges proposed by the future combination of five-element music therapy and AI. Based on Artificial Fish's phenotype, the contents of its chromosome are given. Based on this model, heredity rules are given. Artificial Fish could reproduce and grow in the virtual marine environment freely controlled by the gene model and rules. Each line is then transformed into rectangular patches for character recognition by the text recognition network, comprising a vision-based text recognition model and a language network. Potential e-commercial applications of such AI systems were proposed, benefiting physical and digital fashion businesses. Cognitive models based on Artificial Intelligence is put forward and built to control behaviors of artificial fish in high level. Simulation program is designed and developed based on all these models built above. These made groundwork to improve the efficiency and automatic level of artificial fish animation.
