Real-acting objects are characterized by the presence of various types of random perturbations, which significantly reduce the quality of the control process, which determines the use of modern methods of intellectual technology to solve the problem of synthesis of control systems of structurally complex dynamic objects, allowing to compensate the influence of external factors with the properties of randomness and partial uncertainty. Thus, the precise segmentation of organs and their lesions may contribute to an efficient diagnostics process and a more effective selection of targeted therapies, as well as increasing the effectiveness of the training process. The article considers issues of synthesis of the automatic control system of dynamic objects by applying the theory of intelligent control. In this case, a neural network based on radial-basis functions is used at each discrete interval for neuro-fuzzy approximation of the control system, allowing real-time adjustment of the regulator parameters. The radial basis function is designed to approximate functions defined in the implicit form of pattern sets. The neuro-fuzzy regulator's parameter configuration is accomplished using a genetic algorithm, enabling more efficient computation to determine the regulator's set parameters. The simulation experiments conducted in MATLAB environment show that our system can accurately recognize and extract the main frequency of music, and has higher performance compared to traditional methods. Further, we hypothesized that AI may promote its use in the medical field. The regulator's parameters are represented as a vector, facilitating their application to multidimensional objects. To determine the optimal tuning parameters of the neuro-fuzzy regulator, characterized by high convergence and the possibility of determining global extrema, a genetic algorithm was used. The experiment used piano sound as an example to verify the accuracy and reliability of the system.
