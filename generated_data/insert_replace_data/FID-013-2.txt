The sphere of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is quite wide. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent auxiliary systems have been widely used in various fields. This paper presents the development of a comprehensive, on-site industrial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system tailored for reading text on iron plates. In recent years, music has been regarded as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for a number of physical and mental conditions. Computer vision is also related to other technologies: Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), artificial neural networks, etc. Computer vision is applied in many different areas. Through experimental verification, the intelligent assistant system can monitor studentsâ€™ movements in real time, accurately evaluate their technical level, and provide personalized guidance. One of the areas where it has been widely applied in recent times is healthcare. In healthcare, various algorithms in the aforementioned technologies are used to obtain meaningful information from medical images. In this chapter, the concept of computer vision, its fields of application, and its application in healthcare are reviewed. Also, the example of tumor detection by computer vision in a MATLAB environment is considered.
