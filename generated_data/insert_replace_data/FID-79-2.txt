Real-acting objects are characterized by the presence of various types of random perturbations, which significantly reduce the quality of the control process, which determines the use of modern methods of intellectual technology to solve the problem of synthesis of control systems of structurally complex dynamic objects, allowing to compensate the influence of external factors with the properties of randomness and partial uncertainty. The article considers issues of synthesis of the automatic control system of dynamic objects by applying the theory of intelligent control. In this case, a neural network based on radial-basis functions is used at each discrete interval for neuro-fuzzy approximation of the control system, allowing real-time adjustment of the regulator parameters. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of Midjourney, one such AI system, in both fashion design and related commerce applications. The radial basis function is designed to approximate functions defined in the implicit form of pattern sets. The neuro-fuzzy regulator's parameter configuration is accomplished using a genetic algorithm, enabling more efficient computation to determine the regulator's set parameters. Our study offers contributions to theory and practice in the sports science and applied AI domains. The regulator's parameters are represented as a vector, facilitating their application to multidimensional objects. With the aid of using the system, the volleyball technique level of students has been improved, and the teaching effect has been significantly enhanced. The effectiveness of the neuro-fuzzy regulator is explained by the possibility of providing quality control of the dynamic object under random perturbations and uncertainty of input data.
