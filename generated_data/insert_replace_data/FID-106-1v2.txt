Adaptation and innovation are extremely important to the manufacturing industry. This development should lead to sustainable manufacturing using new technologies. To promote sustainability, smart production requires global perspectives of smart production application technology. With the aid of using the system, the volleyball technique level of students has been improved, and the teaching effect has been significantly enhanced. With the aid of AI, the combination of intelligent technology and on-site teaching solves the lack of individuation in the traditional mode and enhances studentsâ€™ interest in learning. Thus, the aim of the present research was to analyze, systematically, the scientific literature relating to the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) in industry. Through in-depth research, we have designed a music sound recognition system that uses Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) for feature parameter extraction, and combines BP neural network algorithm to construct a music sound learning model. Our results revealed that the area of sports analytics is gaining momentum and AI in the basketball world has more adoption in China, USA, Australia, Canada, Italy and Spain from a research perspective. The analysis was done using the Web of Science and SCOPUS database. Furthermore, UCINET and NVivo 12 software were used to complete them. A literature review on ML and AI empirical studies published in the last century was carried out to highlight the evolution of the topic before and after Industry 4.0 introduction, from 1999 to now. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms have revolutionized the medical image segmentation processes. A first interesting result is the greater number of works published by the USA and the increasing interest after the birth of Industry 4.0.
