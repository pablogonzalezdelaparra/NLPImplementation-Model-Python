This chapter presents a systematic review on the relationship between artificial intelligence and emotions in education in Latin America and the Caribbean. The PRISMA systematic review methodology was used to describe the state of the situation of research on this topic, taking into account theories, methodologies, countries, and educational levels. Subsequently, the detected text region undergoes line-by-line division through a text segmentation network. We consider different types of neural networks used with a special emphasis on the learning rules applied, taking into account algorithm accuracy and performance, as well as open data availability. It is hoped to deepen the research in other disciplines, with other theories and methodologies.
