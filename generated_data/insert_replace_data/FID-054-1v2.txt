Since the 1950s, a significant number of clinical cases have confirmed the effectiveness of art in rehabilitation therapy and psychological interventions. With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, AI painting software based on the Stable Diffusion algorithm model enables image creation through prompts and feedback. As one of the products of the rapid development of information technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves many interdisciplinary subjects, adding new elements to music education. This study tracks and measures the emotional changes in patients before and after using the AI painting software Stable Diffusion WebUI using emotional vocabulary measurement methods. According to the experimental data of this project, artificial intelligence painting can leave a positive impression on human emotions. This paperâ€™s contributions are threefold: (1) the design of a comprehensive, on-site industrial OCR system for autonomous registration of iron plates; (2) the development of a realistic synthetic image generation strategy and a robust data augmentation strategy to address data scarcity; and (3) demonstrated impressive experimental results, indicating potential for on-site industrial applications. As a sport, volleyball has high technical requirements, and the traditional volleyball teaching method has certain limitations. On the other hand, it encourages further research into the effectiveness of traditional painting versus AI-assisted painting in art therapy, aiming to explore the underlying principles and mechanisms of art therapy.
