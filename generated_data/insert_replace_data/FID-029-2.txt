The simulation experiments conducted in MATLAB environment show that our system can accurately recognize and extract the main frequency of music, and has higher performance compared to traditional methods. By analyzing the advantages of AI in music education, this paper systematically summarizes the application of AI in music education and discusses the development prospects of AI in music education. Just as technology is being used to solve all the problems so why not this one. The idea is to make a more convenient and advanced super market experience, where there are no cashiers or lines so that we can shop hassle free. This project implements Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things to automate a supermarket for better efficiency. A person just needs to walk in after scanning their QR code through the app with their unique ID on it. In the last decade, AI use in Orthopaedics increased approximately tenfold. It will record the customer's presence in the shop. The shopping carts and baskets have sensors on them, which can detect the product entering or being taken out. The products are placed on shelves which have pressure sensors to detect if any product is picked up. Midjourney shows promise in streamlining the fashion design process by enhancing ideation and optimizing design details. These shelves are closed and they only open with your shopping cards. When you reach the counter, you only have swipe your card again and money will be deducted from your account according to your purchase and a receipt will be given. As one of the products of the rapid development of information technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves many interdisciplinary subjects, adding new elements to music education.
