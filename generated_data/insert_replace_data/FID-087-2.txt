The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is significantly increasing in many Human Resources (HR) functions. Midjourney shows promise in streamlining the fashion design process by enhancing ideation and optimizing design details. This study employs a Delphi study-based methodology specifically, organising an expert panel that provides their opinions through their ratings and comments of a set of propositions. Each line is then transformed into rectangular patches for character recognition by the text recognition network, comprising a vision-based text recognition model and a language network. In this study, we have delved into the various challenges of matching employee profiles to job profiles and the current problems faced by executives, human resource personnel or supervisors such as project managers in an organisation. The study also sheds light on the potential or feasibility solutions of artificial intelligence in the form of recommender systems where we also test a couple of propositions that focus on potential solutions and various challenges for matching employee profiles to job profiles in an organisation.
