Autonomous vehicle is a typical high-tech comprehensive application, including scene perception, optimization calculation, multi-level assisted driving and other functions, using computer vision, sensors, information fusion, information communication, high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and automatic control and other technologies. The literature indicated cases of sports convergence with the application of fourth industrial revolution technologies, such as the game of go, golf, table tennis, soccer, American football, skiing, archery, and fencing. In these technologies, computer vision, as a direct entry point to data processing, is an integral part of autonomous driving. Secondly, it brings revolutionary changes to the future transportation system. Findings reveal that this AI tool can assist fashion designers in creating both visually expressive attire and ready-to-wear products, meeting defined design criteria and consumer needs. The application of image processing and computer vision in autonomous driving plays a key role in enabling vehicles to perceive and understand the surrounding environment and achieve intelligent decision-making and control. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms have revolutionized the medical image segmentation processes. The research on lane keeping and recognition, obstacle detection and avoidance, traffic signal and sign recognition is of great practical significance.
