The system uses artificial muscle integrated optical equipment, and collects the movement data of students in volleyball training in real time through optical sensors. The metaverse has emerged as an exciting new paradigm for human-computer interaction (HCI) and virtual collaboration. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the metaverse to address the gap in the existing literature where there is a lack of a survey that reviews the nature of the metaverse and its building blocks from a human-centric perspective. We first synthesize a definition of the metaverse from existing literature and delineate key affordances. We then introduce a detailed framework encompassing the metaverses nature, infrastructure technologies, and input/output technologies that facilitate multi-sensory HCI, alongside applications across diverse domains. The components within this framework are explained in depth, offering insights into the metaverses nature and the readiness level of current technologies. The experiment used piano sound as an example to verify the accuracy and reliability of the system. Subsequently, the detected text region undergoes line-by-line division through a text segmentation network.
