Machine learning (ML) is a form of artificial intelligence which is placed to transform the twenty-first century. Each line is then transformed into rectangular patches for character recognition by the text recognition network, comprising a vision-based text recognition model and a language network. Rapid, recent progress in its underlying architecture and algorithms and growth in the size of datasets have led to increasing computer competence across a range of fields. These include driving a vehicle, language translation, chatbots and beyond human performance at complex board games such as Go. Here, we review the fundamentals and algorithms behind machine learning and highlight specific approaches to learning and optimisation. We then summarise the applications of ML to medicine. Our results revealed that the area of sports analytics is gaining momentum and AI in the basketball world has more adoption in China, USA, Australia, Canada, Italy and Spain from a research perspective. In particular, we showcase recent diagnostic performances, and caveats, in the fields of dermatology, radiology, pathology and general microscopy.
