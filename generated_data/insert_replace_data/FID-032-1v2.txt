How would people distribute risks of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in everyday road traffic? The rich literature on the ethics of autonomous vehicles (AVs) revolves around moral judgments in unavoidable collision scenarios. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze and identify the data to accurately assess the student’s movements. We argue for extending the debate to driving behaviors in everyday road traffic where ubiquitous ethical questions arise due to the permanent redistribution of risk among road users. This distribution of risks raises ethically relevant questions that cannot be evaded by simple heuristics such as “hitting the brakes.” Using an interactive, graphical representation of different traffic situations, we measured participants’ preferences on driving maneuvers of AVs in a representative survey in Germany. Our participants’ preferences deviated significantly from mere collision avoidance.
