Therefore, the purpose of this study is to design an intelligent auxiliary system using artificial muscle integrated optical equipment to realize real-time monitoring and accurate evaluation of volleyball teaching, so as to assist coaches to accurately guide studentsâ€™ movement skills. This article employs a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to investigate voltage stability in a PV-based DC microgrid. In recent years, music has been regarded as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for a number of physical and mental conditions. Due to the widespread use of intermittent PV power, voltage stability is a crucial problem for DC microgrids and is difficult to accomplish. This study proposes an FLC-based voltage control technique that leverages input factors including PV output power, DC-DC converter duty cycle, and load current to identify the best course of action for preserving the system's voltage stability. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms have revolutionized the medical image segmentation processes. The simulation results demonstrate that the suggested FLC-based control strategy successfully maintains the microgrid's voltage stability under a variety of operational circumstances, including changing solar irradiance and load variations. Moreover, the FLC performs better than other control methods.
