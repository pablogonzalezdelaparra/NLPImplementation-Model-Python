This paper firstly researches English text emotion expression and information communication, classifies English text emotion expression and information communication according to the human emotion-value relationship, and summarizes the characteristics of English emotion expression and information communication. The vision network performs preliminary recognition, followed by refinement through the language model. Subsequently, the detected text region undergoes line-by-line division through a text segmentation network. To deal with the characteristics of English text quickly and efficiently, it is necessary to encode the emotional information of English text, and based on encoding, the BiLSTM neural network is applied to extract the emotional features of English text and solve the problem of the loss of emotional features through the loss function. With the aid of using the system, the volleyball technique level of students has been improved, and the teaching effect has been significantly enhanced. Then, the crawler tool is used to obtain the dataset from the Chinese English module under the MOOC of Chinese universities, and the evaluation indexes are set according to the modelâ€™s performance, followed by the experimental analysis of the English text emotion expression and information conveyance. The results show that compared with the original CNN, LSTM, and T-LSTM, the BiLSTM-based neural network performs better in the task of text emotion expression and information conveyance, with the accuracy rate staying above 0.925, and the effect on the English dataset is a bit better than that on the Chinese dataset. This study aims to enhance English teaching and communication between Chinese and foreign cultures.
