Basketball in particular, has captured the interest of the real-time analytics and data science community. This study explores the comprehensive understanding of taekwondo, the application of fourth industrial revolution technologies in various kinds of sports, the development of taekwondo through artificial intelligence (AI), and essential technology in the fourth industrial revolution while suggesting advanced science directions through a literature review. In this context, artificial intelligence is seen as one of the major enablers for Smart Logistics and Smart Production initiatives. This paper systematically analyzes the scientific literature on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in the context of Smart Logistics management in industrial enterprises. Furthermore, based on the results of the systematic literature review, the authors present a conceptual framework, which provides fruitful implications based on recent research findings and insights to be used for directing and starting future research initiatives in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) in Smart Logistics.
