The impressive capabilities of living organisms arise from the way autonomy is materialized by their bodies. Across scales, living beings couple computational or cognitive intelligence with physical intelligence through body morphology, material multifunctionality, and mechanical compliance. While soft robotics has advanced the design and fabrication of physically intelligent bodies, the integration of information-processing capabilities for computational intelligence remains a challenge. This study explores the comprehensive understanding of taekwondo, the application of fourth industrial revolution technologies in various kinds of sports, the development of taekwondo through artificial intelligence (AI), and essential technology in the fourth industrial revolution while suggesting advanced science directions through a literature review. This paper presents the development of a comprehensive, on-site industrial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system tailored for reading text on iron plates. Progress toward untethered autonomy will require deliberate convergence in how the field codevelops new materials, fabrication methods, and control strategies for soft robots. With the aid of AI, the combination of intelligent technology and on-site teaching solves the lack of individuation in the traditional mode and enhances students’ interest in learning. Here, a new perspective is put forward: that researchers should use tasks alone to impose material and information constraints on soft robot design. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze and identify the data to accurately assess the student’s movements. Taekwondo is a traditional martial art that originated in Republic of Korea and gradually became a globally recognized sport. This framework allows emergent synergies between material and information processing properties of soft matter to be readily exploited for task-capable agents. Particular attention is paid to the scale dependence of solutions. Finally, an outlook is presented on emerging research opportunities for achieving autonomy in future soft robots as large as elephant trunks and as small as paramecia.
