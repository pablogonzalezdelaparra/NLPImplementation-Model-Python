Using artificial intelligence (AI) to its transformative advantage, the smart vision initiative represents a paradigm shift in the diagnostics and treatment of diabetic retinopathy. With the development, deployment, and experience of AI models by both viewers and players, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive summary of AI applications in basketball. These advanced algorithms are designed for rapid and precise diagnosis, enabling swift interventions to prevent visual impairment by identifying intricate patterns that are invisible to the human eye. Through the identification of complex patterns that are invisible to the human eye, these algorithms guarantee quick and accurate diagnosis. This early detection is crucial as it allows for immediate care, significantly reducing the risk of irreversible vision loss. However, one limitation of this music therapy is that the classification of the five elements and its application is mainly based on subjective judgment. The smart vision initiative sets the stage for a future where diabetic retinopathy no longer leads to blindness, offering a brighter, clearer, and safer optical future for those affected by the condition.
