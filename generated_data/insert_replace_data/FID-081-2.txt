By analyzing the advantages of AI in music education, this paper systematically summarizes the application of AI in music education and discusses the development prospects of AI in music education. Traditional education systems often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to teaching that does not take into account the unique needs and learning styles of each student. In recent years, music has been regarded as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for a number of physical and mental conditions. This makes the learning process more dynamic and personalized. It can therefore be applied to all types of education, including language learning, mathematics, science, etc. This paper presents the development of a comprehensive, on-site industrial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system tailored for reading text on iron plates. However, improving the efficiency of machine learning algorithms depends more on the improvement of numerical optimization algorithms, so it is necessary to summarize the optimization algorithms in large-scale machine learning. This paper tries to make a detailed overview of the existing machine learning algorithms in optimizing personalized education recommendation system, and introduces the algorithm optimization process.
