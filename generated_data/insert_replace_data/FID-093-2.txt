Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands as a pivotal innovation deeply ingrained in both our daily routines and industrial operations. As one of the products of the rapid development of information technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves many interdisciplinary subjects, adding new elements to music education. With the aid of AI, the combination of intelligent technology and on-site teaching solves the lack of individuation in the traditional mode and enhances studentsâ€™ interest in learning. Its rapid evolution promises transformative impacts across various sectors, from cutting-edge industries to the lives of ordinary individuals. AI constantly updates human experiences, shaping interactions and augmenting capabilities. For instance, contemporary educational institutions leverage AI algorithms for attendance tracking via facial recognition technology. Looking ahead, the advent of autonomous vehicles represents a pinnacle of AI application, where vehicles rely entirely on AI systems for navigation, detecting traffic signals, and navigating roads.
