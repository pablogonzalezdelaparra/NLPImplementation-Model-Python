Initially, the system utilizes a text region detection network to identify the text area, enabling camera adjustments along the x and y axes and zoom enhancements for clearer text imagery. We consider different types of neural networks used with a special emphasis on the learning rules applied, taking into account algorithm accuracy and performance, as well as open data availability. The literature and information were obtained from various books and research articles on EBSCO, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of Midjourney, one such AI system, in both fashion design and related commerce applications. Five independent reviewers assessed search results, extracted data, and set the studies’ quality to summarise and report the findings. This paper’s contributions are threefold: (1) the design of a comprehensive, on-site industrial OCR system for autonomous registration of iron plates; (2) the development of a realistic synthetic image generation strategy and a robust data augmentation strategy to address data scarcity; and (3) demonstrated impressive experimental results, indicating potential for on-site industrial applications. Implementing artificial intelligence is a strategic and critical factor in educational development. We employed the action research approach with the Functional, Expressive, and Aesthetic (FEA) Consumer Needs Model as the theoretical framework. They assist teachers and students in various ways, including giving students access to a wide range of learning materials based on their specific learning needs and subjects. However, some risks are associated with artificial intelligence advancements, such as safety, security, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we focus on the AI-based solutions applied in medical image scan segmentation and intelligent visual content generation, i.e., computer-generated three-dimensional (3D) images in the context of extended reality (XR). As one of the products of the rapid development of information technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves many interdisciplinary subjects, adding new elements to music education. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence technologies have positive and negative effects on education. Thus, it is critical to prioritise artificial intelligence in education and implement appropriate strategies to meet teachers' and students' needs and expectations through AI technologies. As a result, academic performance will be excellent. Recommendation & Implication: Qualitative research, such as interviews, or quantitative analysis, such as online questionnaires, may be developed in the future to provide more explanations and explicit findings. The implications could be applied to school administrators, teachers, and students to understand better and implement appropriate strategies to improve educational performance through AI.
