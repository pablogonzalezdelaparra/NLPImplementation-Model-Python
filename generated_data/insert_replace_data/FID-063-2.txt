This study examines the ethical challenges and regulatory dynamics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in relation to data integrity and its influence on social dynamics. Employing a cross-sectional survey approach, primary data was collected from 650 AI practitioners across various sectors, encompassing developers, data scientists, ethicists, and policymakers. Artifcial intelligence helps with tracking activities, evaluating diagnostic images, predicting injury risk, and several other uses. The findings revealed a strong positive correlation between higher levels of regulatory compliance and perceived effectiveness in AI implementation, as well as between AI ethics awareness and data integrity assurance. Moreover, a significant relationship was observed between professional training in AI and its positive impact on social dynamics. However, experience in the AI field, while positively correlated, showed a weaker link to data integrity, indicating that experience alone is insufficient for ensuring effective AI practices. By analyzing the advantages of AI in music education, this paper systematically summarizes the application of AI in music education and discusses the development prospects of AI in music education. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of Midjourney, one such AI system, in both fashion design and related commerce applications. Since taekwondo’s competition analysis is an analysis in which researchers manually write events, it takes a very long time to analyze, and the scale of the analysis varies depending on the researcher’s tendencies. Future research directions include exploring AI ethics and regulation in diverse cultural contexts and the impact of emerging technologies like quantum computing on AI ethics.
