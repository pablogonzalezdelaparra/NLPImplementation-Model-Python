Artificial intelligence (AI) is developing and its application is spreading at an alarming rate, and AI has become part of our daily lives. As a matter of fact, AI has changed the way people learn. This paperâ€™s contributions are threefold: (1) the design of a comprehensive, on-site industrial OCR system for autonomous registration of iron plates; (2) the development of a realistic synthetic image generation strategy and a robust data augmentation strategy to address data scarcity; and (3) demonstrated impressive experimental results, indicating potential for on-site industrial applications. However, its adoption in the educational sector has been saddled with challenges and ethical issues. The fashion industry has shown increasing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI), yet there is a significant gap in exploring the potential of emerging diffusion-modeling-based AI image-generation systems for fashion design and commerce. Our research comprised three stages: refining an initial idea into well-defined textual design concepts, facilitating concept development, and validating the preceding observations and reflections by creating a new line of hemp-based products that were evaluated by targeted consumers through an online survey. The purpose of this study is to analyze the opportunities, benefits, and challenges of AI in education. A review of available and relevant literature was done using the systematic review method to identify the current research focus and provide an in-depth understanding of AI technology in education for educators and future research directions. Findings showed that AI's adoption in education has advanced in the developed countries and most research became popular within the Industry 4.0 era. Other challenges, as well as recommendations, are discussed in the study.
