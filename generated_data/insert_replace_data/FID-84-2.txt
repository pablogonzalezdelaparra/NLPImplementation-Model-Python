Internet of Things (IoT) based remote healthcare applications provide fast and preventative medical services to the patients at risk. However, predicting heart disease is a complex task and diagnosis results are rarely accurate. To address this issue, a novel Recommendation System for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using IoT Network (DEEP-CARDIO) has been proposed for providing prior diagnosis, treatment, and dietary recommendations for cardiac diseases. Initially, the physiological data are collected from the patient’s remotely by using the four bio sensors such as ECG sensor, Pressure sensor, Pulse sensor and Glucose sensor. An Arduino controller receives the collected data from the IoT sensors to predict and diagnose the disease. This paper’s contributions are threefold: (1) the design of a comprehensive, on-site industrial OCR system for autonomous registration of iron plates; (2) the development of a realistic synthetic image generation strategy and a robust data augmentation strategy to address data scarcity; and (3) demonstrated impressive experimental results, indicating potential for on-site industrial applications. Chat Generated Pre-trained
Transformer (ChatGPT), which is an AI-chatbot, represents an extremely controversial topic in the academic community. The simulation experiments conducted in MATLAB environment show that our system can accurately recognize and extract the main frequency of music, and has higher performance compared to traditional methods. The proposed DEEP CARDIO method achieves an overall accuracy of 99.90% whereas, the MABC-SVM, HCBDA and MLbPM method achieves 86.91%, 88.65% and 93.63% respectively.
