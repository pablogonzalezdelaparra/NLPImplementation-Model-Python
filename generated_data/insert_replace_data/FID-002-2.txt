As of 2021, more than 30 countries have released national artificial intelligence (AI) policy strategies. These documents articulate plans and expectations regarding how AI will impact policy sectors, including education, and typically discuss the social and ethical implications of AI. In this paper, we focus on the AI-based solutions applied in medical image scan segmentation and intelligent visual content generation, i.e., computer-generated three-dimensional (3D) images in the context of extended reality (XR). This article engages in thematic analysis of 24 such national AI policy strategies, reviewing the role of education in global AI policy discourse. The study was backed by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework and furthermore utilized computational literature review as well as bibliometric analysis techniques for knowledge extraction purposes. In this paper, we focus on the AI-based solutions applied in medical image scan segmentation and intelligent visual content generation, i.e., computer-generated three-dimensional (3D) images in the context of extended reality (XR). This suggests that AIED and its broader policy and ethical implications—good or bad—have failed to reach mainstream awareness and the agendas of key decision-makers, a concern given that effective policy and careful consideration of ethics are inextricably linked, as this article argues. In light of these findings, the article applies a framework of five AI ethics principles to consider ways in which policymakers can better incorporate AIED’s implications. Potential e-commercial applications of such AI systems were proposed, benefiting physical and digital fashion businesses. Finally, the article offers recommendations for AIED scholars on strategies for engagement with the policymaking process, and for performing ethics and policy-oriented AIED research to that end, in order to shape policy deliberations on behalf of the public good.
