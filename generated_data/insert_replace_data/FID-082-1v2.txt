Thus, the precise segmentation of organs and their lesions may contribute to an efficient diagnostics process and a more effective selection of targeted therapies, as well as increasing the effectiveness of the training process. The study aims to identify recent trends, explore real-life applications, and guide researchers in positioning their research activities in this domain published in 2023 (Jan-June). The literature indicated cases of sports convergence with the application of fourth industrial revolution technologies, such as the game of go, golf, table tennis, soccer, American football, skiing, archery, and fencing. The review highlights the enhanced recommendation accuracy, increased scalability, personalization and context awareness, diverse ML techniques, and strategies for handling cold start and data sparsity, and the foundation for future advancements in ML algorithms for RSs considering the application in manufacturing enterprises.
