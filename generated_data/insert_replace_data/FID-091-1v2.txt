Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a pronounced empirical search algorithm for agent decision-making, especially when enhanced by Deep Learning (DL), in mastering board games that were once thought to be unconquerable. However, it does not appear to be as equally successful in the domain of real-time video games, where the simulation time limit for exploration is a crucial factor, since they are generally designed to be played by human users and hence require a significant amount of resources for simulation. Literature was sourced from six internet search electronic databases, consisting of three English databases and three Korean databases, from January 2016 to August 2023. The key contribution of our work is that we designed a modified MCTS for video games that are both commercial and processed in real-time. With the continuous developments of information technology, advanced computer technology and information technology have been promoted and used in the field of music. This study presented the development of an AI Taekwondo performance improvement analysis and evaluation system and a metaverse-based virtual Taekwondo pumsae/fighting coaching platform through an AI-based motion tracking analysis method.
