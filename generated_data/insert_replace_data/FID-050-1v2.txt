The main challenge we face in this process is how to effectively extract the features of music sounds and accurately identify different tones through algorithms. But due to the inexplicability and black box effect of deep neural networks, we can only obtain results without knowing the applied reasoning behind them. That engenders scepticism and resistance from some quarters of deep learning-based technologies. In the context of emotion analysis used in business and public opinion monitoring, it is sometimes difficult for decision-makers to trust the outcome without explanation from the supposedly emotionless machines. There are mathematical-based explanation methods, and they often generalise emotion analysis as a classification task. Still, emotion should be different from other task categories because the generation of emotion involves human-specific factors and logic. This paper proposes an emotion analysis explanation framework that is grounded in psychological theories focusing on the stimulus from classic emotion theories. Through experimental verification, the intelligent assistant system can monitor studentsâ€™ movements in real time, accurately evaluate their technical level, and provide personalized guidance. This proposed framework emphasises considering the cause and trigger of emotions as the explanation for the deep learning-based emotion analysis, and it includes two main components: the extraction of the emotion cause and the visualisation of emotion-triggering words.
