The advent of autonomous vehicles has heralded a transformative era in transportation, reshaping the landscape of mobility through cutting-edge technologies. Central to this evolution is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and learning algorithms, propelling vehicles into realms of unprecedented autonomy. This paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the evolutionary trajectory of AI within autonomous vehicles, tracing the journey from foundational principles to the most recent advancements. With the aid of AI, the combination of intelligent technology and on-site teaching solves the lack of individuation in the traditional mode and enhances students’ interest in learning. Commencing with a current landscape overview, the paper delves into the fundamental role of AI in shaping the autonomous decision-making capabilities of vehicles. It is noted that, to date, the major limitations of using Midjourney encompass its restriction to only facilitating early fashion design stages and necessitating substantial involvement from designers. The study presents statistical insights into the usage and types of AI/learning algorithms over the years, showcasing the evolving research landscape within the automotive industry. Furthermore, the paper highlights the pivotal role of parameters in refining algorithms for both trucks and cars, facilitating vehicles to adapt, learn, and improve performance over time. It concludes by outlining different levels of autonomy, elucidating the nuanced usage of AI and learning algorithms, and automating key tasks at each level. Additionally, the document discusses the variation in software package sizes across different autonomy levels
