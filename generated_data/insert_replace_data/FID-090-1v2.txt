Video games have been in the focus of the research and academic community for the last few years, with the study and experimentation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) standing out. This paperâ€™s contributions are threefold: (1) the design of a comprehensive, on-site industrial OCR system for autonomous registration of iron plates; (2) the development of a realistic synthetic image generation strategy and a robust data augmentation strategy to address data scarcity; and (3) demonstrated impressive experimental results, indicating potential for on-site industrial applications. AGI experimentation platforms allow to analyze and study, in a visual way, the behavior of different AI agents previously defined. By analyzing the advantages of AI in music education, this paper systematically summarizes the application of AI in music education and discusses the development prospects of AI in music education. In this work a novel game engine, called GAGI, capable of serving as an AGI experimentation platform is presented. These sports not only use big data but also virtual reality and augmented reality. Moreover, GAGI provides the user with a unique environment for simulating and studying AI agents inside the created game. Users can deploy multiple AI agents while interacting with them in real time, improving the understanding of their interactions and behaviors. The features of the proposed software is compared against others widely-used game engines in the video games industry as well as in the research community, highlighting the advantages in terms of design capability and AI support. GAGI also offers the possibility to reproduce the experiments, opening up multiple possibilities for the research community.
