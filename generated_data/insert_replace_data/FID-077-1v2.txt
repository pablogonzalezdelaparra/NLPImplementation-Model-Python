Here, we discussed the challenges proposed by the future combination of five-element music therapy and AI. Conventional direct torque control and indirect control with flux orientation have some drawbacks, such as current harmonics, torque ripples, flux ripples, and rise time. By analyzing the advantages of AI in music education, this paper systematically summarizes the application of AI in music education and discusses the development prospects of AI in music education. Results from the simulation show that the direct torque control method using fuzzy logic is more effective in providing a precise and fast response without overshooting, and it eliminates torque and flux fluctuations at low switching frequencies. The demonstrated improvements in dynamic performance contribute to increased operational efficiency and reliability in industrial applications.
