The fashion industry has shown increasing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI), yet there is a significant gap in exploring the potential of emerging diffusion-modeling-based AI image-generation systems for fashion design and commerce. 
Well-being is one of the pillars of positive psychology, which is known to have positive effects not only on the personal and professional lives of individuals but also on teams and organizations. Understanding and promoting individual well-being is essential for staff health and long-term success, but current tools for assessing subjective well-being rely on time-consuming surveys and questionnaires, which limit the possibility of providing the real-time feedback needed to raise awareness and change individual behavior. This paper proposes a framework for understanding the process of non-verbal communication in teamwork, using video data to identify significant predictors of individual well-being in teamwork. It relies on video acquisition technologies and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence tools to extract individual, relative, and environmental characteristics from panoramic video. Statistical analysis is applied to each time series, leading to the generation of a dataset of 125 features, which are then linked to PERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishments) surveys developed in the context of positive psychology. Each pillar of the PERMA model is evaluated as a regression or classification problem using machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze and identify the data to accurately assess the studentâ€™s movements. The experiment used piano sound as an example to verify the accuracy and reliability of the system. This enabled us to formulate several hypotheses identifying factors influencing individual well-being in teamwork. These promising results point to interesting avenues for research, for instance fusing different media for the analysis of individual well-being in teamwork.
