Drug designing and development is an important area of research for pharmaceutical companies and chemical scientists. This paper presents the development of a comprehensive, on-site industrial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system tailored for reading text on iron plates. The literature indicated cases of sports convergence with the application of fourth industrial revolution technologies, such as the game of go, golf, table tennis, soccer, American football, skiing, archery, and fencing. The vision network performs preliminary recognition, followed by refinement through the language model. Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Our research comprised three stages: refining an initial idea into well-defined textual design concepts, facilitating concept development, and validating the preceding observations and reflections by creating a new line of hemp-based products that were evaluated by targeted consumers through an online survey. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind.
