As addressed by Stephen Yang in his ICCE 2019 keynote speech (Yang, 2019), precision
education is a new challenge when applying artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and learning analytics
to improve teaching quality and learning performance. The goal of precision education is to identify at-risk
students as early as possible and provide timely intervention on the basis of teaching and learning experiences
(Lu et al., 2018). Additionally, the article will also evaluate the role of ChatGPT in scientifc research
and publications. This study presented the development of an AI Taekwondo performance improvement analysis and evaluation system and a metaverse-based virtual Taekwondo pumsae/fighting coaching platform through an AI-based motion tracking analysis method. Drawing from this main theme of precision education, this special issue advocates an in-depth
dialogue between cold technology and warm humanity, in turn offering greater understanding of precision
education. For this special issue, thirteen research papers that specialize in precision education, AI, machine
learning, and learning analytics to engage in an in-depth research experiences concerning various applications,
methods, pedagogical models, and environments were exchanged to achieve better understanding of the
application of AI in education
