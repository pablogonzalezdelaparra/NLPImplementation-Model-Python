The study was backed by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework and furthermore utilized computational literature review as well as bibliometric analysis techniques for knowledge extraction purposes. Current efforts encounter challenges in balancing intra- and inter-speaker context dependencies when tackling intra-modal interactions. This balance is vital as it encompasses modeling self-dependency (emotional inertia) where speakers' own emotions affect them and modeling interpersonal dependencies (empathy) where counterparts' emotions influence a speaker. Furthermore, challenges arise in addressing cross-modal interactions that involve content with conflicting emotions across different modalities. To address this issue, we introduce an adaptive interactive graph network (IGN) called AdaIGN that employs the Gumbel Softmax trick to adaptively select nodes and edges, enhancing intra- and cross-modal interactions. Unlike undirected graphs, we use a directed IGN to prevent future utterances from impacting the current one. Next, we propose Node- and Edge-level Selection Policies (NESP) to guide node and edge selection, along with a Graph-Level Selection Policy (GSP) to integrate the utterance representation from original IGN and NESP-enhanced IGN. With the development, deployment, and experience of AI models by both viewers and players, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive summary of AI applications in basketball. To reduce computational complexity, we use pre-defined pseudo labels through self-supervised methods to mask unnecessary utterance nodes for selection. Experimental results show that AdaIGN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two popular datasets. Our code will be available at https://github.com/TuGengs/AdaIGN.
