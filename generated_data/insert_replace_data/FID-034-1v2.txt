Throughout the last decades, the number of vehicles on the road has steadily increased due to the rising demand for urban mobility and contemporary logistics. With the continuous developments of information technology, advanced computer technology and information technology have been promoted and used in the field of music. Two of the many detrimental effects of more vehicles on the road, which also impede economic development, are increased traffic congestion and traffic accidents. The issues mentioned above can be significantly resolved by making vehicles smarter by reducing their reliance on humans. Over the past century, various nations have conducted extensive research that has fueled the automation of road vehicles. Initially, the system utilizes a text region detection network to identify the text area, enabling camera adjustments along the x and y axes and zoom enhancements for clearer text imagery. Undoubtedly, the widespread use of autonomous cars is more imminent than we realize given the development of artificial intelligence (AI). Since taekwondo’s competition analysis is an analysis in which researchers manually write events, it takes a very long time to analyze, and the scale of the analysis varies depending on the researcher’s tendencies. In order for AVs to perceive their surroundings and make the right decisions in real time, AI has emerged as a crucial component. This development of AI is being driven by the growth of big data from numerous sensing devices and cutting-edge computing resources. Basketball in particular, has captured the interest of the real-time analytics and data science community. We must first examine AI's development and history in order to comprehend its functions in AV systems.
