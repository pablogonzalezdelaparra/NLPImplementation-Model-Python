This paper presents the development of a comprehensive, on-site industrial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system tailored for reading text on iron plates. There are many individual and collaborative AI-based technologies available. Each line is then transformed into rectangular patches for character recognition by the text recognition network, comprising a vision-based text recognition model and a language network. Literature was sourced from six internet search electronic databases, consisting of three English databases and three Korean databases, from January 2016 to August 2023. In this paper, we focus on the AI-based solutions applied in medical image scan segmentation and intelligent visual content generation, i.e., computer-generated three-dimensional (3D) images in the context of extended reality (XR). Computer vision is applied in many different areas. One of the areas where it has been widely applied in recent times is healthcare. In healthcare, various algorithms in the aforementioned technologies are used to obtain meaningful information from medical images. In this chapter, the concept of computer vision, its fields of application, and its application in healthcare are reviewed. Also, the example of tumor detection by computer vision in a MATLAB environment is considered.
