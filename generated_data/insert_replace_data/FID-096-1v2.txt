Providing an appropriate difficulty level in a game is critical for keeping players engaged. Thus, the precise segmentation of organs and their lesions may contribute to an efficient diagnostics process and a more effective selection of targeted therapies, as well as increasing the effectiveness of the training process. The fashion industry has shown increasing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI), yet there is a significant gap in exploring the potential of emerging diffusion-modeling-based AI image-generation systems for fashion design and commerce. For this purpose, we examined DDA studies using employed machine-learning techniques, player modeling approaches, data types used to assess players states, testbed game genre, and application. Journal and conference articles published up to September 2022 served as the data sources in this review. The simulation experiments conducted in MATLAB environment show that our system can accurately recognize and extract the main frequency of music, and has higher performance compared to traditional methods. In addition, machine-learning and player modeling techniques have recently received more attention in the DDA design. However, given the ever-increasing use of games in various domains, more research is needed to understand player preferences better to adjust game parameters efficiently. By conducting further research into players cognitive characteristics, such as visual attention, working memory, and response time, it will be possible to understand players preferences better.
