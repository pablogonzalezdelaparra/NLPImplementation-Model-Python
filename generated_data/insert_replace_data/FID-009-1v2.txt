As one of the products of the rapid development of information technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves many interdisciplinary subjects, adding new elements to music education. Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various industries, including education. This paperâ€™s contributions are threefold: (1) the design of a comprehensive, on-site industrial OCR system for autonomous registration of iron plates; (2) the development of a realistic synthetic image generation strategy and a robust data augmentation strategy to address data scarcity; and (3) demonstrated impressive experimental results, indicating potential for on-site industrial applications. Our study offers contributions to theory and practice in the sports science and applied AI domains. This research work aims to explore the
application of AI in educational management, including its benefits and challenges. The research work employs a systematic review
methodology, examining the literature on AI in educational management. The study finds that AI has several advantages, including
improving student engagement, personalization of learning, and cost-effectiveness. However, AI also poses several challenges, such as
ethical concerns, potential biases, and the need for re-skilling the workforce. The research concludes that AI has an enormous capacity
to improve educational management, but it must be deployed with care and caution.
