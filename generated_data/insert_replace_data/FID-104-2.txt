Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) have revolutionized the field of advanced robotics in recent years. AI, ML, and DL are transforming the field of advanced robotics, making robots more intelligent, efficient, and adaptable to complex tasks and environments. Our proposed music sound learning model is based on a BP neural network, which trains the network to learn the mapping relationship between music sound and pitch. The main purpose is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of music teaching through artificial intelligence technology. These technologies are also being used in the development of collaborative robots (cobots) that can work alongside humans and adapt to changing environments and tasks. The AI, ML, and DL can be used in advanced transportation systems in order to provide safety, efficiency, and convenience to the passengers and transportation companies . Also, the AI, ML, and DL are playing a critical role in the advancement of manufacturing assembly robots, enabling them to work more efficiently, safely, and intelligently. Furthermore, they have a wide range of applications in aviation management, helping airlines to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Moreover, the AI, ML, and DL can help taxi companies in order to provide better, more efficient, and safer services to customers. The research presents an overview of current developments in AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics systems and discusses various applications of the systems in robot modification. Additionally, the article will also evaluate the role of ChatGPT in scientifc research
and publications. By reviewing the applications of AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics systems, it is possible to investigate and modify the performances of advanced robots in various applications in order to enhance productivity in advanced robotic industries.
