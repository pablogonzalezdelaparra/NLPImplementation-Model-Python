Recent technological developments have enabled computers to identify and categorize facial expressions to determine a personâ€™s emotional state in an image or a video. It is noted that, to date, the major limitations of using Midjourney encompass its restriction to only facilitating early fashion design stages and necessitating substantial involvement from designers. In recent times, deep FER systems have primarily concentrated on addressing two significant challenges: the problem of overfitting due to limited training data availability, and the presence of expression-unrelated variations, including illumination, head pose, image resolution, and identity bias. In this paper, a comprehensive survey is provided on deep FER, encompassing algorithms and datasets that offer insights into these intrinsic problems. Initially, this paper presents a detailed timeline showcasing the evolution of methods and datasets in deep facial expression recognition (FER). With the development, deployment, and experience of AI models by both viewers and players, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive summary of AI applications in basketball. Then, a comprehensive review of FER methods is introduced, including the basic principles of FER (components such as preprocessing, feature extraction and classification, and methods, etc.) from the pro-deep learning era (traditional methods using handcrafted features, i.e., SVM and HOG, etc.) This paper presents the development of a comprehensive, on-site industrial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system tailored for reading text on iron plates. Additionally, the article will also evaluate the role of ChatGPT in scientifc research
and publications. Moreover, a brief introduction is provided related to the benchmark datasets (there are two categories: controlled environments (lab) and uncontrolled environments (in the wild)) used to evaluate different FER methods and a comparison of different FER models. Existing deep neural networks and related training strategies designed for FER, based on static images and dynamic image sequences, are discussed. The remaining challenges and corresponding opportunities in FER and the future directions for designing robust deep FER systems are also pinpointed.
