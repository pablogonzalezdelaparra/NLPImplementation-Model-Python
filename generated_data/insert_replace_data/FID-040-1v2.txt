Human-AI interaction has become an important focus in the development of more responsive and humane technology. In this context, the use of artificial empathy strategies is of particular interest due to its potential in improving customer experiences affectively and socially. This research aims to explore the optimization of human-AI interactions through the application of artificial empathy strategies in improving affective and social customer experiences. This review is performed based on literature sourced from Web of Science and Dimensions databases, where articles were thoroughly examined to identify AI use cases. This study explores the comprehensive understanding of taekwondo, the application of fourth industrial revolution technologies in various kinds of sports, the development of taekwondo through artificial intelligence (AI), and essential technology in the fourth industrial revolution while suggesting advanced science directions through a literature review. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent auxiliary systems have been widely used in various fields. The data sources used are journals, articles and books that are relevant to the research topic. From the research results, it was found that the implementation of artificial empathy strategies in human-AI interactions has great potential to improve the quality of interactions and customer experiences. The use of technologies such as natural language processing, emotion recognition, and sentiment analysis can enable AI to respond more precisely and sensitively to user needs and emotions.
