Network news is an important way for netizens to get social information. Massive news information hinders netizens to get key information. Named entity recognition technology under artificial background can realize the classification of place, date and other information in text information. This article combines named entity recognition and deep learning technology. In recent years, music has been regarded as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for a number of physical and mental conditions. Our research comprised three stages: refining an initial idea into well-defined textual design concepts, facilitating concept development, and validating the preceding observations and reflections by creating a new line of hemp-based products that were evaluated by targeted consumers through an online survey. The method jointly trains sentence and trigger vectors through a trigger-matching network, utilizing the trigger vectors as attention queries for subsequent sequence annotation models. Furthermore, the proposed method employs entity labels to effectively recognize neologisms in web news, enabling the customization of the set of sensitive words and the number of words within the set to be detected, as well as extending the web news word sentiment lexicon for sentiment observation. Through experimental verification, the intelligent assistant system can monitor studentsâ€™ movements in real time, accurately evaluate their technical level, and provide personalized guidance. Thus, the precise segmentation of organs and their lesions may contribute to an efficient diagnostics process and a more effective selection of targeted therapies, as well as increasing the effectiveness of the training process. Moreover, the loss function curve shows that my model exhibits better accuracy and faster convergence speed than the compared model. Finally, my model achieves an average accuracy rate of 97.88% in sentiment viewpoint detection.
