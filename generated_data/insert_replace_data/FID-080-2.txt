Easy internet access and technological advancements have resulted in information overload and a plethora of options, making decision-making extremely difficult. Recommender System (RS) is a potential solution for assisting users in making decisions by recommending or predicting product ratings. Three fundamental forms of RS that use implicit or explicit feedback for recommendation are collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent auxiliary systems have been widely used in various fields. These additional variables can have a significant impact on RS’s performance. Traditional RSs used approaches based on the nearest neighbor or other machine learning models, but thanks to recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning, RSs are now being developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which can efficiently exploit auxiliary information. This study presented the development of an AI Taekwondo performance improvement analysis and evaluation system and a metaverse-based virtual Taekwondo pumsae/fighting coaching platform through an AI-based motion tracking analysis method. Here, we discussed the challenges proposed by the future combination of five-element music therapy and AI. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to design an intelligent auxiliary system using artificial muscle integrated optical equipment to realize real-time monitoring and accurate evaluation of volleyball teaching, so as to assist coaches to accurately guide students’ movement skills.
