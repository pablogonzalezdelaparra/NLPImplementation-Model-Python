As one of the products of the rapid development of information technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves many interdisciplinary subjects, adding new elements to music education. Automated driving vehicles operate autonomously, also known as driverless cars that can operate without a human driver. Research on autonomous vehicles has substantially advanced in recent years. By analyzing the advantages of AI in music education, this paper systematically summarizes the application of AI in music education and discusses the development prospects of AI in music education. In this paper, we focus on the AI-based solutions applied in medical image scan segmentation and intelligent visual content generation, i.e., computer-generated three-dimensional (3D) images in the context of extended reality (XR). Although some people might be apprehensive to give a computer control of their vehicle, automated driving technologies have the potential to make roads safer. It has the potential to effectively provide individualized music therapy to individuals with illness. Unlike humans, computers do not really have difficulty keeping attention when driving. Additionally, by responding appropriately, an automated car can prevent accidents to potentially dangerous events on the road. The system uses artificial muscle integrated optical equipment, and collects the movement data of students in volleyball training in real time through optical sensors. For a variety of reasons, such as inexperience, incapacity, or age, many people are unable to operate a vehicle. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent auxiliary systems have been widely used in various fields. Therefore, we will explore the architectures of both software and hardware of autonomous cars in this chapter, as well as their parts, benefits, and future developments.
