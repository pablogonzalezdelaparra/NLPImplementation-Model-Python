It is noted that, to date, the major limitations of using Midjourney encompass its restriction to only facilitating early fashion design stages and necessitating substantial involvement from designers. The most frequently used T-norms for computing the firing strengths are product and minimum operators of which the former is often preferred because of its differentiability. However, for high-dimensional problems, the product T-norm suffers from the numeric underflow problem. Here, we primarily focus on addressing the problem that is associated with the use of the T-norms for designing high-dimensional FISs (HDFISs). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to design an intelligent auxiliary system using artificial muscle integrated optical equipment to realize real-time monitoring and accurate evaluation of volleyball teaching, so as to assist coaches to accurately guide studentsâ€™ movement skills. The OCR results are then converted into digital characters and recorded in the iron plate registration system. The main novelty is that we propose an adaptive dimension-dependent membership function (DMF). For the minimum T-norm, an empirical observation led us to develop a mechanism that has the natural ability to deal with super high-dimensional problems, which results in another HDFIS named HDFIS-min. Findings reveal that this AI tool can assist fashion designers in creating both visually expressive attire and ready-to-wear products, meeting defined design criteria and consumer needs. The simulation results demonstrate that both of them have competitive performance on handling high-dimensional datasets.
