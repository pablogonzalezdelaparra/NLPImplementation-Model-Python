How would people distribute risks of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in everyday road traffic? The rich literature on the ethics of autonomous vehicles (AVs) revolves around moral judgments in unavoidable collision scenarios. We argue for extending the debate to driving behaviors in everyday road traffic where ubiquitous ethical questions arise due to the permanent redistribution of risk among road users. Our study offers contributions to theory and practice in the sports science and applied AI domains. This distribution of risks raises ethically relevant questions that cannot be evaded by simple heuristics such as “hitting the brakes.” Using an interactive, graphical representation of different traffic situations, we measured participants’ preferences on driving maneuvers of AVs in a representative survey in Germany. Our participants’ preferences deviated significantly from mere collision avoidance. The main challenge we face in this process is how to effectively extract the features of music sounds and accurately identify different tones through algorithms. With the development, deployment, and experience of AI models by both viewers and players, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive summary of AI applications in basketball.
