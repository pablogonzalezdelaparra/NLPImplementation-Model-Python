This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of the research and application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in recommender systems (RS). Our research comprised three stages: refining an initial idea into well-defined textual design concepts, facilitating concept development, and validating the preceding observations and reflections by creating a new line of hemp-based products that were evaluated by targeted consumers through an online survey. Midjourney shows promise in streamlining the fashion design process by enhancing ideation and optimizing design details. The review highlights the enhanced recommendation accuracy, increased scalability, personalization and context awareness, diverse ML techniques, and strategies for handling cold start and data sparsity, and the foundation for future advancements in ML algorithms for RSs considering the application in manufacturing enterprises.
