Face recognition has a very important role in various applications, from security, surveillance to authentication. Subsequently, the detected text region undergoes line-by-line division through a text segmentation network. For safety most of the household is having CC cameras such that they could recognize the persons from it. These CCTV are allocated for having safety and to know who visited their houses. The vision network performs preliminary recognition, followed by refinement through the language model. In few highly secured places where allowance to any unknown intruder is strictly prohibited. Potential e-commercial applications of such AI systems were proposed, benefiting physical and digital fashion businesses. The design specified is successfully implemented using HOG feature extraction and SVM classification algorithms and it classifies the faces for a video stream given as input. The major objective entitled to this paper is to recognize the faces of people from the video by HOG feature extractor and classify them using SVM and train the machine to tell who is the person working for the organization and who are the intruder.
