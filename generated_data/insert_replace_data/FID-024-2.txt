With the continuous developments of information technology, advanced computer technology and information technology have been promoted and used in the field of music. Chat Generated Pre-trained
Transformer (ChatGPT), which is an AI-chatbot, represents an extremely controversial topic in the academic community. The experiment used piano sound as an example to verify the accuracy and reliability of the system. Deep facial recognition has made significant progress and is widely applied in real-world scenarios. A complete facial recognition system involves three main components: facial recognition, orientation, and representation. This system detects faces, aligns them to a standard view, and extracts features for recognition using deep convolutional neural networks. This article provides a detailed overview of the latest advancements in these areas, showing how deep learning has greatly enhanced their abilities. Object detection in machine vision is a challenging area that requires significant improvements. While image classification accuracy is nearing 2.25%, surpassing human performance, object detection algorithms are still in the early stages. Current algorithms achieve only 40.8 MAPS on modern objects, so careful dataset selection is crucial for optimal results.
