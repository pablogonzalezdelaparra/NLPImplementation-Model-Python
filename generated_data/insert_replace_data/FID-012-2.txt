By analyzing the advantages of AI in music education, this paper systematically summarizes the application of AI in music education and discusses the development prospects of AI in music education. The literature indicated cases of sports convergence with the application of fourth industrial revolution technologies, such as the game of go, golf, table tennis, soccer, American football, skiing, archery, and fencing. Agriculture is the ultimate imperative and primary source of origin to furnish domestic income for multifarious countries. This paperâ€™s contributions are threefold: (1) the design of a comprehensive, on-site industrial OCR system for autonomous registration of iron plates; (2) the development of a realistic synthetic image generation strategy and a robust data augmentation strategy to address data scarcity; and (3) demonstrated impressive experimental results, indicating potential for on-site industrial applications. The disease caused in plants due to various pathogens like viruses, fungi, and bacteria is liable for considerable monetary losses in the agriculture corporation across the world. The security of crops concerning quality and quantity is crucial to monitor disease in plants. The vision network performs preliminary recognition, followed by refinement through the language model. The plant disease syndrome is noticeable in distinct parts of plants. Nonetheless, commonly the infection is detected in distinct leaves of plants. Computer vision, deep learning, few-shot learning, and soft computing techniques are utilized by various investigators to automatically identify the disease in plants via leaf images. These techniques also benefit farmers in achieving expeditious and appropriate actions to avoid a reduction in the quality and quantity of crops. The application of these techniques in the recognition of disease can avert the disadvantage of origin by a factious selection of disease features, extraction of features, and boost the speed of technology and efficiency of research. Also, certain molecular techniques have been established to prevent and mitigate the pathogenic threat. Thus, the precise segmentation of organs and their lesions may contribute to an efficient diagnostics process and a more effective selection of targeted therapies, as well as increasing the effectiveness of the training process. Hence, this review helps the investigator to automatically detect disease in plants using machine learning, deep learning and few shot learning and provide certain diagnosis techniques to prevent disease. Moreover, some of the future works in the classification of disease are also discussed.
