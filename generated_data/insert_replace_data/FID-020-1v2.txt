This paper introduces a study employing artificial intelligence (AI) to utilize computer vision algorithms for detecting human emotions in video content during user interactions with diverse visual stimuli. Thus, the precise segmentation of organs and their lesions may contribute to an efficient diagnostics process and a more effective selection of targeted therapies, as well as increasing the effectiveness of the training process. The research aims to unveil the creation of software capable of emotion detection by leveraging AI algorithms and image processing pipelines to identify users' facial expressions. The process involves assessing users through images and facilitating the implementation of computer vision algorithms aligned with psychological theories defining emotions and their recognizable features. Five-elements music therapy—based on the five-element theory—is a unique non-pharmacological therapy of East Asian traditional medicine. The results highlight successful emotion identification; however, precision improvement necessitates further training for contexts with more diverse images and additional algorithms to distinguish closely related emotional patterns. The discussion and conclusions emphasize the potential of A.I. and computer vision algorithms in emotion detection, providing insights into software development, ongoing training, and the evolving landscape of emotion recognition technology. Further training is necessary for contexts with more diverse images, alongside additional algorithms that can effectively distinguish between facial expressions depicting closely related emotional patterns, enhancing certainty and accuracy.
