Medical image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, playing a pivotal role in applications such as diagnostics, treatment planning, and medical research. The present study explores a wide range of methodologies employed in the field of medical research to achieve image segmentation. The main challenge we face in this process is how to effectively extract the features of music sounds and accurately identify different tones through algorithms. The strengths and limitations of each method are thoroughly examined. This paper focuses on analyzing various architectures used for medical image segmentation, specifically evaluating their performance. Further, we hypothesized that AI may promote its use in the medical field. This can develop five-element music therapy. As one of the products of the rapid development of information technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves many interdisciplinary subjects, adding new elements to music education. This research enhances the comprehension of how these methods can be applied within the medical sector, especially in the area of computer vision.
