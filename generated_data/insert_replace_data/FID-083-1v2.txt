The system uses artificial muscle integrated optical equipment, and collects the movement data of students in volleyball training in real time through optical sensors. In this context, recommender systems, tools that offer personalised suggestions to city dwellers, have emerged as key contributors to this convergence. Their successful application in various areas of city life and their ability to process massive amounts of data generated in urban environments has expedited their status as a crucial technology in the evolution of city planning. The study was backed by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework and furthermore utilized computational literature review as well as bibliometric analysis techniques for knowledge extraction purposes. The first stage consisted of carrying out a bibliometric analysis with the objective of analysing structural aspects with the SciMAT tool. Secondly, a systematic literature review was undertaken using the PRISMA 2020 statement. The results illustrated the different processes by which recommendations are filtered in areas such as tourism, health, mobility, and transport. This research is seen as a significant breakthrough that can drive the evolution and efficiency of smart cities, establishing a solid framework for future research in this dynamic field.
