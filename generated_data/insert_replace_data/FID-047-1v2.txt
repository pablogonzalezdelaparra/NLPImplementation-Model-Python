With the continuous progress of art education and artificial intelligence technology, traditional music teaching models are facing transformation. By scrutinizing the direct influence of human emotional intelligence on investment choices and elucidating the mediating role of AI in this process, our research seeks to unravel the complex interplay between minds and machines. The OCR results are then converted into digital characters and recorded in the iron plate registration system. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that EI not only directly impacts ID but also exerts its influence indirectly through AI-mediated pathways. The findings underscore the pivotal role of emotional awareness in investor decision-making, augmented by the technological capabilities of AI. It suggests that most investors are influenced by the identified emotional intelligence when making investment decisions. Furthermore, AI substantially impacts investors' decision-making process when it comes to investing; nevertheless, AI partially mediates the relationship between emotional intelligence and investment decisions. With the continuous progress of art education and artificial intelligence technology, traditional music teaching models are facing transformation. Our research comprised three stages: refining an initial idea into well-defined textual design concepts, facilitating concept development, and validating the preceding observations and reflections by creating a new line of hemp-based products that were evaluated by targeted consumers through an online survey.
