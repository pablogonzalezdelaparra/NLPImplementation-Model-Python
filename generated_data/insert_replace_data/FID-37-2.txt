The potential for connected automated vehicles is multifaceted, and automated advancement deals with more of Internet of Things (IoTs) development enabling artificial intelligence (AI). Early advancements in engineering, electronics, and many other fields have inspired AI. Further, we hypothesized that AI may promote its use in the medical field. There are several proposals of technologies used in automated vehicles. Automated vehicles contribute greatly toward traffic optimization and casualty reduction. In studying vehicle autonomy, there are two categories of development available: high-level system integrations like new-energy vehicles and intelligent transportation systems and the other involves backward subsystem advancement like sensor and information processing systems. The Advanced Driver Assistance System shows results that meet the expectations of real-world problems in vehicle autonomy. In this paper, we focus on the AI-based solutions applied in medical image scan segmentation and intelligent visual content generation, i.e., computer-generated three-dimensional (3D) images in the context of extended reality (XR). The system is equipped with an interactive interface that shows students correct demonstrations of movements and provides real-time feedback and guidance. This chapter discusses the history of autonomous vehicles (AV), trending research areas of artificial intelligence technology in AV, state-of-the-art datasets used for AV research, and several Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) algorithms constituting the functioning of AV as a system, concluding with the challenges and opportunities of AI in AV.
