Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands as a pivotal innovation deeply ingrained in both our daily routines and industrial operations. Subsequently, the detected text region undergoes line-by-line division through a text segmentation network. AI constantly updates human experiences, shaping interactions and augmenting capabilities. For instance, contemporary educational institutions leverage AI algorithms for attendance tracking via facial recognition technology. However, one limitation of this music therapy is that the classification of the five elements and its application is mainly based on subjective judgment. Looking ahead, the advent of autonomous vehicles represents a pinnacle of AI application, where vehicles rely entirely on AI systems for navigation, detecting traffic signals, and navigating roads.
