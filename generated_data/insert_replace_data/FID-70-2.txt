As one of the products of the rapid development of information technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves many interdisciplinary subjects, adding new elements to music education. With the continuous developments of information technology, advanced computer technology and information technology have been promoted and used in the field of music. By employing fuzzy logic controls, the ideal placement of distribution generators (DGs) can be determined, ensuring the reliability indices are identified through optimal power flow solutions and fuzzy logic controllers to maintain system feasibility. Our results revealed that the area of sports analytics is gaining momentum and AI in the basketball world has more adoption in China, USA, Australia, Canada, Italy and Spain from a research perspective. To identify areas of weakness, especially within transmission companies, accessing optimal power flow algorithms becomes essential in a deregulated power system. Both transmission and distribution networks should be appropriately adjusted to alleviate congestion within the respective companies. The aggregator must assess system performance, utilizing data obtained from distribution and transmission companies within the deregulated power system.
