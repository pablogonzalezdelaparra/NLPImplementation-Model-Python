Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) have revolutionized the field of advanced robotics in recent years. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of Midjourney, one such AI system, in both fashion design and related commerce applications. The fashion industry has shown increasing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI), yet there is a significant gap in exploring the potential of emerging diffusion-modeling-based AI image-generation systems for fashion design and commerce. Some of the applications of AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics include autonomous navigation, object recognition and manipulation, natural language processing, and predictive maintenance. These technologies are also being used in the development of collaborative robots (cobots) that can work alongside humans and adapt to changing environments and tasks. The AI, ML, and DL can be used in advanced transportation systems in order to provide safety, efficiency, and convenience to the passengers and transportation companies . This can develop five-element music therapy. Also, the AI, ML, and DL are playing a critical role in the advancement of manufacturing assembly robots, enabling them to work more efficiently, safely, and intelligently. Furthermore, they have a wide range of applications in aviation management, helping airlines to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. The main purpose is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of music teaching through artificial intelligence technology. Moreover, the AI, ML, and DL can help taxi companies in order to provide better, more efficient, and safer services to customers. The research presents an overview of current developments in AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics systems and discusses various applications of the systems in robot modification. Further research works regarding the applications of AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics systems are also suggested in order to fill the gaps between the existing studies and published papers. By reviewing the applications of AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics systems, it is possible to investigate and modify the performances of advanced robots in various applications in order to enhance productivity in advanced robotic industries.
