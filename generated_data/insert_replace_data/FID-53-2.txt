This paper introduces a study employing artificial intelligence (AI) to utilize computer vision algorithms for detecting human emotions in video content during user interactions with diverse visual stimuli. The research aims to unveil the creation of software capable of emotion detection by leveraging AI algorithms and image processing pipelines to identify users' facial expressions. The process involves assessing users through images and facilitating the implementation of computer vision algorithms aligned with psychological theories defining emotions and their recognizable features. By analyzing the advantages of AI in music education, this paper systematically summarizes the application of AI in music education and discusses the development prospects of AI in music education. The results highlight successful emotion identification; however, precision improvement necessitates further training for contexts with more diverse images and additional algorithms to distinguish closely related emotional patterns. The discussion and conclusions emphasize the potential of A.I. With the continuous developments of information technology, advanced computer technology and information technology have been promoted and used in the field of music. Further training is necessary for contexts with more diverse images, alongside additional algorithms that can effectively distinguish between facial expressions depicting closely related emotional patterns, enhancing certainty and accuracy.
