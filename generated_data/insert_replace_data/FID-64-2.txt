In the last decade, AI use in Orthopaedics increased approximately tenfold. They raise the questions:
1. whether it is possible to communicate with, understand, and even empathically perceive artificial agents;
2. whether we should ascribe actual subjectivity and thus quasi-personal status to them beyond a certain level of simulation;
3. what will be the impact of an increasing dissolution of the distinction between simulated and real encounters. It concludes with possible developments and open challenges in AI applications in extended reality-based solutions. This assumption is ultimately based on the presupposition of a shared form of life, conceived here as �conviviality.�
(2) The possibility that future artificial agents could meet these preconditions is refuted on the basis of embodied and enactive cognition, which links subjectivity and consciousness to the aliveness of an organism. Initially, the system utilizes a text region detection network to identify the text area, enabling camera adjustments along the x and y axes and zoom enhancements for clearer text imagery. Here, possible consequences are discussed, especially using the example of virtual psychotherapy. Finally, the paper makes case for a mindful appproach to the language we use to talk about artificial systems and pleads for preventing a systematic pretense of subjectivity.
