Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) has emerged as a highly sensitive, adaptable, and effective technology for material analysis. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to design an intelligent auxiliary system using artificial muscle integrated optical equipment to realize real-time monitoring and accurate evaluation of volleyball teaching, so as to assist coaches to accurately guide studentsâ€™ movement skills. In this comprehensive review, we delve into the historical background, instrumentation, and diverse applications of IGC. Researchers and practitioners will find valuable information on the selection and description of numerous models used in IGC experiments. The aim of this review article is to simplify the concept of AI and study the extent of AI use in Orthopaedics
and sports medicine literature. Furthermore, IGC facilitates the measurement of important parameters such as sorption enthalpy and entropy, surface energy components (dispersive and specific), co/adhesion work, glass transition temperature, surface heterogeneity, miscibility, solubility parameters, and specific surface area. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of material behavior and aid in the design and optimization of advanced materials. Moreover, the integration of computer vision and image processing techniques with IGC has enhanced our understanding of materials intricate surface texture, roughness, and related properties. Artifcial intelligence (AI) is looked upon nowadays as the potential major catalyst for the fourth industrial revolution. This paper not only provides a comprehensive overview of IGC, its techniques, and applications but also highlights the synergistic potential of combining IGC with AI and computer vision. The informative content and insights presented here will benefit researchers, scientists, and professionals in the field of advanced materials, enabling them to leverage IGC and AI for innovative materials discovery and development.
