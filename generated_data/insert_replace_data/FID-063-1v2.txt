This study examines the ethical challenges and regulatory dynamics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in relation to data integrity and its influence on social dynamics. Employing a cross-sectional survey approach, primary data was collected from 650 AI practitioners across various sectors, encompassing developers, data scientists, ethicists, and policymakers. The study investigated the correlations between regulatory compliance, ethical awareness, professional training, and experience in AI practice with the effectiveness of AI implementation and data integrity. The findings revealed a strong positive correlation between higher levels of regulatory compliance and perceived effectiveness in AI implementation, as well as between AI ethics awareness and data integrity assurance. Our results revealed that the area of sports analytics is gaining momentum and AI in the basketball world has more adoption in China, USA, Australia, Canada, Italy and Spain from a research perspective. The study was backed by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework and furthermore utilized computational literature review as well as bibliometric analysis techniques for knowledge extraction purposes. However, experience in the AI field, while positively correlated, showed a weaker link to data integrity, indicating that experience alone is insufficient for ensuring effective AI practices. The study highlights the importance of ethical considerations, regulatory frameworks, and professional training in shaping AI development and its societal implications. We consider different types of neural networks used with a special emphasis on the learning rules applied, taking into account algorithm accuracy and performance, as well as open data availability. Future research directions include exploring AI ethics and regulation in diverse cultural contexts and the impact of emerging technologies like quantum computing on AI ethics.
