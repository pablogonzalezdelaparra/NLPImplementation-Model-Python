The experiment used piano sound as an example to verify the accuracy and reliability of the system. With the aid of AI, the combination of intelligent technology and on-site teaching solves the lack of individuation in the traditional mode and enhances studentsâ€™ interest in learning. Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various industries, including education. AI is being used in educational management
to enhance the learning process, improve student outcomes, and streamline administrative tasks. This research work aims to explore the
application of AI in educational management, including its benefits and challenges. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms have revolutionized the medical image segmentation processes. The study finds that AI has several advantages, including
improving student engagement, personalization of learning, and cost-effectiveness. However, AI also poses several challenges, such as
ethical concerns, potential biases, and the need for re-skilling the workforce. The research concludes that AI has an enormous capacity
to improve educational management, but it must be deployed with care and caution.
