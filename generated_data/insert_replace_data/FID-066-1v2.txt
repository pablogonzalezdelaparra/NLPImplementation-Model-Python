As a sport, volleyball has high technical requirements, and the traditional volleyball teaching method has certain limitations. Across scales, living beings couple computational or cognitive intelligence with physical intelligence through body morphology, material multifunctionality, and mechanical compliance. Since taekwondo’s competition analysis is an analysis in which researchers manually write events, it takes a very long time to analyze, and the scale of the analysis varies depending on the researcher’s tendencies. Consequently, perception and control limitations have constrained how soft robots are built today. We employed the action research approach with the Functional, Expressive, and Aesthetic (FEA) Consumer Needs Model as the theoretical framework. Progress toward untethered autonomy will require deliberate convergence in how the field codevelops new materials, fabrication methods, and control strategies for soft robots. Here, a new perspective is put forward: that researchers should use tasks alone to impose material and information constraints on soft robot design. A conceptual framework is proposed for a task-first design paradigm that sidesteps limitations imposed by control strategies. This framework allows emergent synergies between material and information processing properties of soft matter to be readily exploited for task-capable agents. The designed autonomous system enhances iron plate registration efficiency and significantly reduces factory time and labor costs. Finally, an outlook is presented on emerging research opportunities for achieving autonomy in future soft robots as large as elephant trunks and as small as paramecia.
