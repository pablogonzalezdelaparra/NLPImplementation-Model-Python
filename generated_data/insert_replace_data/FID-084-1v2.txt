Internet of Things (IoT) based remote healthcare applications provide fast and preventative medical services to the patients at risk. However, predicting heart disease is a complex task and diagnosis results are rarely accurate. Finally, future lines of research and development directions of artificial intelligence applications, both in medical image segmentation and extended reality-based medical solutions, are discussed. Our study offers contributions to theory and practice in the sports science and applied AI domains. Initially, the physiological data are collected from the patient’s remotely by using the four bio sensors such as ECG sensor, Pressure sensor, Pulse sensor and Glucose sensor. An Arduino controller receives the collected data from the IoT sensors to predict and diagnose the disease. A cardiovascular disease prediction model is implemented by using BiGRU (Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit) attention model which diagnose the cardiovascular disease and classify into five available cardiovascular classes. This review is performed based on literature sourced from Web of Science and Dimensions databases, where articles were thoroughly examined to identify AI use cases. The performance of the DEEP-CARDIO is validated by Cloud Simulator (CloudSim) using the real-time Framingham’s and Statlog heart disease dataset. The proposed DEEP CARDIO method achieves an overall accuracy of 99.90% whereas, the MABC-SVM, HCBDA and MLbPM method achieves 86.91%, 88.65% and 93.63% respectively.
