The potential for connected automated vehicles is multifaceted, and automated advancement deals with more of Internet of Things (IoTs) development enabling artificial intelligence (AI). Early advancements in engineering, electronics, and many other fields have inspired AI. There are several proposals of technologies used in automated vehicles. Potential e-commercial applications of such AI systems were proposed, benefiting physical and digital fashion businesses. Chat Generated Pre-trained
Transformer (ChatGPT), which is an AI-chatbot, represents an extremely controversial topic in the academic community. The Advanced Driver Assistance System shows results that meet the expectations of real-world problems in vehicle autonomy. Situational intelligence that collects enormous amounts of data is considered for high-definition creation of city maps, land surveying, and quality checking of roads as well. The infotainment system of the transport covers the driver's gesture recognition, language transaction, and perception of the surroundings with the assistance of a camera, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and Radio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) along with localization of the objects in the scene. This chapter discusses the history of autonomous vehicles (AV), trending research areas of artificial intelligence technology in AV, state-of-the-art datasets used for AV research, and several Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) algorithms constituting the functioning of AV as a system, concluding with the challenges and opportunities of AI in AV.
