In the evolving landscape of financial decision-making, this study delves into the intricate relationships among Emotional Intelligence (EI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Investment Decisions (ID). It is noted that, to date, the major limitations of using Midjourney encompass its restriction to only facilitating early fashion design stages and necessitating substantial involvement from designers. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that EI not only directly impacts ID but also exerts its influence indirectly through AI-mediated pathways. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze and identify the data to accurately assess the student’s movements. It suggests that most investors are influenced by the identified emotional intelligence when making investment decisions. This paper’s contributions are threefold: (1) the design of a comprehensive, on-site industrial OCR system for autonomous registration of iron plates; (2) the development of a realistic synthetic image generation strategy and a robust data augmentation strategy to address data scarcity; and (3) demonstrated impressive experimental results, indicating potential for on-site industrial applications. This nuanced understanding provides valuable insights for financial practitioners, policymakers, and researchers, emphasizing the need for holistic strategies that integrate emotional and technological dimensions in navigating the intricacies of modern investment landscapes. As the synergy between human intuition and artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integral to financial decision-making, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the symbiotic relationship between minds and machines in investments
