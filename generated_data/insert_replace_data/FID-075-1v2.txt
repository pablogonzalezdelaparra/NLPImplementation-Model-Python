This article delves into the intricacies of adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control for nonholonomic multirobot systems characterized by infinite actuator faults and range constraints. To address these issues, we leverage the power of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and employ adaptive methods to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and uncertain parameters present in robotic dynamics. In the course of information exploration, the problems of collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance are ever present due to limitations of distance and visual fields. Potential e-commercial applications of such AI systems were proposed, benefiting physical and digital fashion businesses. Furthermore, to reduce the number of controller executions and compensate for any effect arising from infinite actuator failures, robots engage with their leader at the moment of actuator faults using fewer network communication resources yet maintain uninterrupted tracking of the desired trajectory generated by the leader. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled the acoustic analysis of multi-factor sound sources. Our study offers contributions to theory and practice in the sports science and applied AI domains. However, one limitation of this music therapy is that the classification of the five elements and its application is mainly based on subjective judgment. Ultimately, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of the ETFT control strategy for nonholonomic multirobot systems.
