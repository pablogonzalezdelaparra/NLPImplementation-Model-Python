Our research comprised three stages: refining an initial idea into well-defined textual design concepts, facilitating concept development, and validating the preceding observations and reflections by creating a new line of hemp-based products that were evaluated by targeted consumers through an online survey. In this article, the causes of technological disturbances in electrical systems are considered, and several characteristic disadvantages of the protection and automation of elements of electrical systems are highlighted. The tendency to decrease the reliability of relay protection associated with the transition from analog to digital types of protection is substantiated. Based on the studied examples, the use of fuzzy logic in protections, the expediency of using fuzzy logic elements in protection devices, and the automation of electrical systems to identify types of short circuits are justified. This article analyzes the most common damages and presents the results of modeling an electrical system with transformer coupling, where all types of asymmetric short circuits were initiated. The main purpose is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of music teaching through artificial intelligence technology. The dynamics of changes in the symmetrical components of short-circuit currents of the forward, reverse, and zero sequences are determined. Rules have been created for the identification of asymmetric types of short circuits. Through experimental verification, the intelligent assistant system can monitor studentsâ€™ movements in real time, accurately evaluate their technical level, and provide personalized guidance. An algorithm of protection and automation operation using fuzzy logic elements has been developed. The proposed algorithm of protection and automation will reduce the time to determine the type of damage and trigger protections.
