With the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in education, the number of published studies in the field has increased. The study was backed by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework and furthermore utilized computational literature review as well as bibliometric analysis techniques for knowledge extraction purposes. However, no large-scale reviews have been conducted to comprehensively investigate the various aspects of this field. Based on 4,519 publications from 2000 to 2019, we attempt to fill this gap and identify trends and topics related to AI applications in education (AIEd) using topicbased bibliometrics. Results of the review reveal an increasing interest in using AI for educational purposes from the academic community. This study presented the development of an AI Taekwondo performance improvement analysis and evaluation system and a metaverse-based virtual Taekwondo pumsae/fighting coaching platform through an AI-based motion tracking analysis method. Midjourney shows promise in streamlining the fashion design process by enhancing ideation and optimizing design details. We also discuss the challenges and future directions of AIEd.
