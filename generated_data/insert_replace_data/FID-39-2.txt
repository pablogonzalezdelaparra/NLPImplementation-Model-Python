The advent of autonomous vehicles has heralded a transformative era in transportation, reshaping the landscape of mobility through cutting-edge technologies. Central to this evolution is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and learning algorithms, propelling vehicles into realms of unprecedented autonomy. Our research comprised three stages: refining an initial idea into well-defined textual design concepts, facilitating concept development, and validating the preceding observations and reflections by creating a new line of hemp-based products that were evaluated by targeted consumers through an online survey. Commencing with a current landscape overview, the paper delves into the fundamental role of AI in shaping the autonomous decision-making capabilities of vehicles. It elucidates the steps involved in the AI-powered development life cycle in vehicles, addressing ethical considerations and bias in AI-driven software development for autonomous vehicles. The study presents statistical insights into the usage and types of AI/learning algorithms over the years, showcasing the evolving research landscape within the automotive industry. Chat Generated Pre-trained
Transformer (ChatGPT), which is an AI-chatbot, represents an extremely controversial topic in the academic community. It has the potential to effectively provide individualized music therapy to individuals with illness. Furthermore, the paper highlights the pivotal role of parameters in refining algorithms for both trucks and cars, facilitating vehicles to adapt, learn, and improve performance over time. It concludes by outlining different levels of autonomy, elucidating the nuanced usage of AI and learning algorithms, and automating key tasks at each level. Additionally, the document discusses the variation in software package sizes across different autonomy levels
