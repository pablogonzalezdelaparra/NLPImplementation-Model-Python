Whether the application of exergames in physical education (PE) courses can significantly improve student performance in PE learning is still controversial. This review explores the promoting effect of exergames on student PE learning and the conditions in which the effect of exergames can be maximized. Based on the PICOS method, two researchers independently searched the ProQuest database, EBSCO database, Web of Science (WoS) database, PubMed database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Wanfang database, and VIP database, evaluated the literature quality using the Cochrane system evaluation manual, and performed a meta-analysis of the included literature. A total of 16 randomized controlled trials involving 2962 subjects were included in this study. Here, we discussed the challenges proposed by the future combination of five-element music therapy and AI. By analyzing the advantages of AI in music education, this paper systematically summarizes the application of AI in music education and discusses the development prospects of AI in music education. Subgroup analysis indicated that better results could be achieved when exergames were introduced in small kindergarten classes and continued for 1–2 months.
