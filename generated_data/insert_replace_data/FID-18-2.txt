The system is equipped with an interactive interface that shows students correct demonstrations of movements and provides real-time feedback and guidance. We consider different types of neural networks used with a special emphasis on the learning rules applied, taking into account algorithm accuracy and performance, as well as open data availability. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to design an intelligent auxiliary system using artificial muscle integrated optical equipment to realize real-time monitoring and accurate evaluation of volleyball teaching, so as to assist coaches to accurately guide studentsâ€™ movement skills. Secondly, it brings revolutionary changes to the future transportation system. The application of image processing and computer vision in autonomous driving plays a key role in enabling vehicles to perceive and understand the surrounding environment and achieve intelligent decision-making and control. Therefore, in combination with the application of computer vision and artificial intelligence in automatic driving, this paper expounds the image processing technology in automatic driving, including camera and sensor technology, image acquisition and preprocessing, feature extraction and object detection, so as to discuss the application of computer vision algorithm in automatic driving. The research on lane keeping and recognition, obstacle detection and avoidance, traffic signal and sign recognition is of great practical significance.
