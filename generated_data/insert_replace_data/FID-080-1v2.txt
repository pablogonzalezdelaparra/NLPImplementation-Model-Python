Easy internet access and technological advancements have resulted in information overload and a plethora of options, making decision-making extremely difficult. We employed the action research approach with the Functional, Expressive, and Aesthetic (FEA) Consumer Needs Model as the theoretical framework. Three fundamental forms of RS that use implicit or explicit feedback for recommendation are collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering. The aim of this review article is to simplify the concept of AI and study the extent of AI use in Orthopaedics
and sports medicine literature. These additional variables can have a significant impact on RSâ€™s performance. Traditional RSs used approaches based on the nearest neighbor or other machine learning models, but thanks to recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning, RSs are now being developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which can efficiently exploit auxiliary information. In addition to comparing CNN-based RSs on common grounds, this article provides a full examination of CNN-based RSs and how they might use various types of auxiliary information. The study also discusses data characteristics, data statistics, and auxiliary information in a variety of publicly available datasets. Literature was sourced from six internet search electronic databases, consisting of three English databases and three Korean databases, from January 2016 to August 2023.
