Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) has emerged as a highly sensitive, adaptable, and effective technology for material analysis. Through employing thermochemical approaches, IGC provides crucial insight into physicochemical information of materials such as dispersive surface free energy, Gibbs surface energy components and Guttamann Lewis acid-base parameters. In this comprehensive review, we delve into the historical background, instrumentation, and diverse applications of IGC. This study explores the comprehensive understanding of taekwondo, the application of fourth industrial revolution technologies in various kinds of sports, the development of taekwondo through artificial intelligence (AI), and essential technology in the fourth industrial revolution while suggesting advanced science directions through a literature review. The applications of IGC span various domains, including polymers, medicines, minerals, surfactants, and nanomaterials. This study explores the comprehensive understanding of taekwondo, the application of fourth industrial revolution technologies in various kinds of sports, the development of taekwondo through artificial intelligence (AI), and essential technology in the fourth industrial revolution while suggesting advanced science directions through a literature review. With the aid of AI, the combination of intelligent technology and on-site teaching solves the lack of individuation in the traditional mode and enhances studentsâ€™ interest in learning. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of material behavior and aid in the design and optimization of advanced materials. Moreover, the integration of computer vision and image processing techniques with IGC has enhanced our understanding of materials intricate surface texture, roughness, and related properties. This convergence of IGC with computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) presents exciting opportunities for future exploration of chemical materials, opening new avenues for research and discovery. Literature was sourced from six internet search electronic databases, consisting of three English databases and three Korean databases, from January 2016 to August 2023. This paper not only provides a comprehensive overview of IGC, its techniques, and applications but also highlights the synergistic potential of combining IGC with AI and computer vision. The informative content and insights presented here will benefit researchers, scientists, and professionals in the field of advanced materials, enabling them to leverage IGC and AI for innovative materials discovery and development.
