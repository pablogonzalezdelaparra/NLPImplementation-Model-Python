installed on the modern intelligent vehicles. Many Artificial Intelligence based foundation models have been proposed for smart sensing to recognize the known object classes in the new but similar scenarios. By analyzing the advantages of AI in music education, this paper systematically summarizes the application of AI in music education and discusses the development prospects of AI in music education. However, it is still challenging for the foundation models of smart sensing to detect all the object classes in both seen and unseen scenarios. This letter aims at pushing the boundary of smart sensing research for intelligent vehicles. Through in-depth research, we have designed a music sound recognition system that uses Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) for feature parameter extraction, and combines BP neural network algorithm to construct a music sound learning model. We then explain Sora-based Parallel Vision to boost the foundation models of smart sensing from basic intelligence (1.0) to enhanced intelligence (2.0) and final generalized intelligence (3.0). Several representative case studies are discussed to show the potential usages of Sora-based Parallel Vision, followed by its future research direction.
