The main purpose is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of music teaching through artificial intelligence technology. Facial recognition technology (FRT) is one of the most successful and fascinating technologies of the modern times. The world is moving towards contactless FRT after the COVID-19 pandemic. As one of the products of the rapid development of information technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves many interdisciplinary subjects, adding new elements to music education. Businesses are replacing conventional fingerprint scanners with artificial intelligenceâ€”based FRT, opening up enormous commercial prospects. Security and surveillance, authentication/access control systems, digital healthcare, photo retrieval, etc., are some sectors where its use has become essential. In the present communication, we presented the global adoption of FRT, its rising trend in the market, utilization of the technology in various sectors, its challenges and rising concerns with special reference to India and worldwide.
