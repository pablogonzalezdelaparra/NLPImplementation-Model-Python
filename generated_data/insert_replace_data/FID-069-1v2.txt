This work reports an experience in using an Artificial Life competitive game that simulates an artificial life environment for unstructured and informal Artificial Intelligence (AI) teaching to students from computer science engineering careers. With the aid of AI, the combination of intelligent technology and on-site teaching solves the lack of individuation in the traditional mode and enhances students’ interest in learning. The game consists of a simulated Petri dish where two colonies of microorganisms-software agents-must struggle to survive. To achieve this goal, the participants must implement surviving strategies for their agents, which include fighting strategies and basic reproduction rules to prevail over all the artificial environment. The technical bases of the contest as well as a description of the artificial life model are explained in detail. Five-elements music therapy—based on the five-element theory—is a unique non-pharmacological therapy of East Asian traditional medicine.
