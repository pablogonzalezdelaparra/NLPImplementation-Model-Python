Artificial intelligence is one of the emerging technologies that simulate human intelligence in machines by programming it to think like human beings and mimic their actions. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled the acoustic analysis of multi-factor sound sources. This innovative technology may provide increased passenger safety, less congested roads, congestion reduction, optimum traffic, lower fuel consumption, less pollution, and better travel experiences. Five-elements music therapy—based on the five-element theory—is a unique non-pharmacological therapy of East Asian traditional medicine. The autonomous vehicle's activities are supported by sensor data and a few artificial intelligence systems. The OCR results are then converted into digital characters and recorded in the iron plate registration system. Artificial intelligence is the collection of data, path planning, and execution in autonomous vehicles that require some machine learning techniques that are a part of artificial intelligence. But this comes with some privacy issues and security concerns. With the continuous progress of art education and artificial intelligence technology, traditional music teaching models are facing transformation. The issues of cybersecurity while incorporating artificial intelligence in autonomous vehicles will be covered in this article, along with the growing technology of self-driving automobiles.
