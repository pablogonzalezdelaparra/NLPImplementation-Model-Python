At present, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in industrial control, smart home and other fields has received good response. Literature was sourced from six internet search electronic databases, consisting of three English databases and three Korean databases, from January 2016 to August 2023. However, AI technology has certain requirements for computer performance, and also faces problems in network security, data analysis, human-computer interaction, etc. In this paper, we focus on the AI-based solutions applied in medical image scan segmentation and intelligent visual content generation, i.e., computer-generated three-dimensional (3D) images in the context of extended reality (XR). At present, the visual platform of embedded system has achieved remarkable results in practical applications, but its development has been seriously hampered by problems such as low overall development efficiency and unstable system performance. By analyzing the advantages of AI in music education, this paper systematically summarizes the application of AI in music education and discusses the development prospects of AI in music education. The platform combined the embedded hardware design with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to realize the intelligent robot interaction and target detection functions. The test results showed that when other conditions were the same, students and experts had 83.5% and 90% positive evaluations of System X, and 16.5% and 10% negative evaluations respectively. However, their positive evaluation of System Y only accounted for 19% and 4%, while the negative evaluation accounted for 81% and 96%. The proportion of positive evaluation of System X was much higher than that of System Y, which indicated that System X can meet the actual application requirements and improve the system recognition efficiency to a certain extent. Finally, future lines of research and development directions of artificial intelligence applications, both in medical image segmentation and extended reality-based medical solutions, are discussed. It showed the positive relationship between AI technology and EP VS.
