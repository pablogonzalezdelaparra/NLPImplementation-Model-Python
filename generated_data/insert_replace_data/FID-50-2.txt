The aim of this review article is to simplify the concept of AI and study the extent of AI use in Orthopaedics
and sports medicine literature. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled the acoustic analysis of multi-factor sound sources. But due to the inexplicability and black box effect of deep neural networks, we can only obtain results without knowing the applied reasoning behind them. That engenders scepticism and resistance from some quarters of deep learning-based technologies. In the context of emotion analysis used in business and public opinion monitoring, it is sometimes difficult for decision-makers to trust the outcome without explanation from the supposedly emotionless machines. There are mathematical-based explanation methods, and they often generalise emotion analysis as a classification task. Still, emotion should be different from other task categories because the generation of emotion involves human-specific factors and logic. Since taekwondo’s competition analysis is an analysis in which researchers manually write events, it takes a very long time to analyze, and the scale of the analysis varies depending on the researcher’s tendencies. The sports industry is progressively embracing technological advancements, and artificial intelligence stands out as a prominent innovation. This proposed framework emphasises considering the cause and trigger of emotions as the explanation for the deep learning-based emotion analysis, and it includes two main components: the extraction of the emotion cause and the visualisation of emotion-triggering words.
