Commercial applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have made remarkable progress recently, particularly in areas such as image recognition, natural speech processing, language translation, textual analysis, and self-learning. Progress had historically languished in these areas, such that these skills had come to seem ineffably bound to intelligence. The study was backed by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework and furthermore utilized computational literature review as well as bibliometric analysis techniques for knowledge extraction purposes. The practice of anesthesiology is different. It embodies a requirement for high reliability, and a pressured cycle of interpretation, physical action, and response rather than any single cognitive act. With the aid of AI, the combination of intelligent technology and on-site teaching solves the lack of individuation in the traditional mode and enhances students’ interest in learning. Initially, the system utilizes a text region detection network to identify the text area, enabling camera adjustments along the x and y axes and zoom enhancements for clearer text imagery. Relevant clinical questions are introduced to illustrate how machine learning might help solve them—perhaps bringing anesthesiology into an era of machine-assisted discovery.
