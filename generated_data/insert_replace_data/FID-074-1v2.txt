This article employs a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to investigate voltage stability in a PV-based DC microgrid. Several photovoltaic (PV) modules, a DC-DC converter, and loads make up the microgrid. The literature indicated cases of sports convergence with the application of fourth industrial revolution technologies, such as the game of go, golf, table tennis, soccer, American football, skiing, archery, and fencing. Thus, the precise segmentation of organs and their lesions may contribute to an efficient diagnostics process and a more effective selection of targeted therapies, as well as increasing the effectiveness of the training process. The FLC's performance is assessed by simulation, and it is meant to be resilient to parameter fluctuations and uncertainties. As one of the products of the rapid development of information technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves many interdisciplinary subjects, adding new elements to music education. Moreover, the FLC performs better than other control methods.
