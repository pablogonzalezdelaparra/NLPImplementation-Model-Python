Therefore, the purpose of this study is to design an intelligent auxiliary system using artificial muscle integrated optical equipment to realize real-time monitoring and accurate evaluation of volleyball teaching, so as to assist coaches to accurately guide studentsâ€™ movement skills. The game consists of a simulated Petri dish where two colonies of microorganisms-software agents-must struggle to survive. This review is performed based on literature sourced from Web of Science and Dimensions databases, where articles were thoroughly examined to identify AI use cases. The technical bases of the contest as well as a description of the artificial life model are explained in detail. The pedagogical experience acquired in the contest development is discussed, as well as the resulting learning experience, which generated students enthusiasm and has helped them to develop mental models of possible AI algorithms.
