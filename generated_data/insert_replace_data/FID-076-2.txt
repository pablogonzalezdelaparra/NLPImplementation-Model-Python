Fuzzy inference systems (FISs) have been developed for many years but the use of FISs for high-dimensional problems is still a challenging task. The aim of this review article is to simplify the concept of AI and study the extent of AI use in Orthopaedics
and sports medicine literature. The OCR results are then converted into digital characters and recorded in the iron plate registration system. Here, we primarily focus on addressing the problem that is associated with the use of the T-norms for designing high-dimensional FISs (HDFISs). Artifcial intelligence (AI) is looked upon nowadays as the potential major catalyst for the fourth industrial revolution. The main novelty is that we propose an adaptive dimension-dependent membership function (DMF). For the minimum T-norm, an empirical observation led us to develop a mechanism that has the natural ability to deal with super high-dimensional problems, which results in another HDFIS named HDFIS-min. This can develop five-element music therapy. The simulation results demonstrate that both of them have competitive performance on handling high-dimensional datasets.
