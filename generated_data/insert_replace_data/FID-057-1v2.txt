In the last decade, AI use in Orthopaedics increased approximately tenfold. Network news is an important way for netizens to get social information. With the aid of AI, the combination of intelligent technology and on-site teaching solves the lack of individuation in the traditional mode and enhances studentsâ€™ interest in learning. Named entity recognition technology under artificial background can realize the classification of place, date and other information in text information. As a sport, volleyball has high technical requirements, and the traditional volleyball teaching method has certain limitations. This article aims to construct an art education and teaching system based on artificial intelligence, especially for teaching music sound recognition. Specifically, the proposed method introduces an automatic annotation approach for Chinese entity triggers and a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that can achieve high accuracy with a small number of training data sets. The method jointly trains sentence and trigger vectors through a trigger-matching network, utilizing the trigger vectors as attention queries for subsequent sequence annotation models. Furthermore, the proposed method employs entity labels to effectively recognize neologisms in web news, enabling the customization of the set of sensitive words and the number of words within the set to be detected, as well as extending the web news word sentiment lexicon for sentiment observation. With the continuous developments of information technology, advanced computer technology and information technology have been promoted and used in the field of music. Moreover, the loss function curve shows that my model exhibits better accuracy and faster convergence speed than the compared model. Finally, my model achieves an average accuracy rate of 97.88% in sentiment viewpoint detection.
