The main idea of this paper is the substantiation of the methodological approach to the assessment of personnel risks of enterprises based on the application of the fuzzy logic apparatus in order to identify the problems of personnel risk management and provide appropriate recommendations for their solution. The methodological basis of the study is the classic provisions and fundamental works of foreign and domestic scientists, statistical data, the results of our research into the problems of assessing personnel risks of enterprises. As a sport, volleyball has high technical requirements, and the traditional volleyball teaching method has certain limitations. The study proposed a methodological approach to assessing the level of personnel risks of an enterprise; numerical experiments were conducted on the basis of a group of construction equipment manufacturers. In recent years, music has been regarded as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for a number of physical and mental conditions. Indicators are functions of fuzzy coefficients: F1 = r(v1, v2, v3); F2 = g(v4,v5, v6, v7); F3 = h(v8, v9, v10,); F4=q(v11, v12). This article aims to construct an art education and teaching system based on artificial intelligence, especially for teaching music sound recognition. Here, the functions r, g, h, q, f are unknown functions of the given variables. We have expert evaluations of the change in all input data; as a rule, they vary within three terms: Low (I), Medium (G), High (E). Artifcial intelligence (AI) is looked upon nowadays as the potential major catalyst for the fourth industrial revolution. Formalized information on each variable can be written as , then for a group of indicators we have: . Using a fuzzy system and performing calculations with its help requires the system to have the following structural elements: membership functions of input and output variables, a rule base, and an output mechanism. These structural elements are the components that will be built when designing a fuzzy system. The built mathematical model and the method of its formalization on the basis of FST make it possible to estimate the level of personnel risk at the enterprise, which enables further substantiation of a set of measures to increase the efficiency of its use. The constructed system of fuzzy logical inference can be considered intelligent as it uses elements of computational intelligence, in particular, the theory of fuzzy sets. This paper attempts to summarize the current development of AI-based segmentation methods in medical imaging and intelligent visual content generation that are applied in XR.
