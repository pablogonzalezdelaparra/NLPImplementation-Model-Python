Accurate trajectory tracking is unrealistic in real-world scenarios, however, which is commonly assumed to facilitate motion planning algorithm design. In this paper, a safe and reliable motion planning and control framework is proposed to handle the tracking errors caused by inaccurate tracking by coordinating the motion planning layer and controller. Specifically, motion space is divided into safe regions and risky regions by designing the movement restraint size dependent on tracking error to construct the repulsive potential field. The OCR results are then converted into digital characters and recorded in the iron plate registration system. The collision-free waypoint set can then be obtained by combining global search and the proposed waypoint set filtering method. The planned trajectory is fitted by an optimization-based approach which minimizes the acceleration of the reference trajectory. The system is equipped with an interactive interface that shows students correct demonstrations of movements and provides real-time feedback and guidance. Then, the planned trajectory is checked and modified by the designed anti-collision modification to ensure safety. With the continuous developments of information technology, advanced computer technology and information technology have been promoted and used in the field of music. Because tracking error is considered and margined at the planning level, safety and reliability can be guaranteed by the coordination between the planning and control levels under inaccurate tracking and actuator faults. The advantages and effectiveness of the proposed motion planning and control method are verified by simulation and experimental results.
