This paper presents the development of a comprehensive, on-site industrial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system tailored for reading text on iron plates. This research introduces a revolutionary positional self-attention transformer model for the classification of bacterial colonies. Leveraging the proven success of transformer architectures in various domains, we enhanced the model's performance by integrating a positional self-attention mechanism. We presented a novel approach for bacterial colony classification utilizing a positional self-attention transformer model. This allows the model to effectively capture spatial relationships and patterns within bacterial colonies, contributing to highly accurate classification results. We trained the model on a substantial dataset of bacterial images, which ensures its robustness and generalization to diverse colony types. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent auxiliary systems have been widely used in various fields. The proposed model demonstrated remarkable performance, achieving an accuracy of 98.50% in the classification of bacterial colonies. By using the MFCC algorithm, we have successfully solved this problem as it can effectively describe the time-frequency characteristics of music sound. It has the potential to effectively provide individualized music therapy to individuals with illness. The model's adaptability to diverse colony shapes and arrangements marks a significant advancement, promising to redefine the landscape of bacterial colony classification through the lens of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The high classification accuracy attained by the model, suggests its potential for practical applications in the early diagnosis of infectious diseases and the development of targeted treatments. The findings of this study underscore the effectiveness of incorporating positional self-attention in transformer models for image-based classification tasks, particularly in the domain of bacterial colony analysis.
