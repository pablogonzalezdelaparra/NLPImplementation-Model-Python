The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled the acoustic analysis of multi-factor sound sources. The aim of this paper is present an experimental approach in Implementation of fuzzy logic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) with boost converter based on Arduino Mega micro-controller to maximize energy production in different weather condition applied to small scale pumping system for water and chemical fluid analyses in isolated area. The system is supplied by 20 (W) solar photovoltaic (PV) panel. As one of the products of the rapid development of information technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves many interdisciplinary subjects, adding new elements to music education. This paper present a real-time MATLAB/Simulink fuzzy logic method controlling and monitoring MPPT application using an low cost Arduino Mega micro-controller combined with (LV25, LP55) sensors controlling boost converter interconnected with solar panel and plastic pump.
