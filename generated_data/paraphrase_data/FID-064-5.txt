The progress in artificial intelligence (AI) is leading to a growing resemblance in the way AI systems or AI-based robots perform and communicate compared to humans. The questions they pose are as follows: 1. Is it feasible to speak with, comprehend, and perhaps empathetically perceive artificial agents? Whether we should attribute genuine subjectivity and therefore quasi-personal status to them after they reach a certain level of simulation. The increasing dissolution of the distinction between simulated and real encounters will have a significant impact. In order to comprehend others, it is essential to acknowledge the subjectivity of our counterparts, which enables the experience of shared emotions and a collective intentionality. This paper argues that these factors are crucial for understanding the consequences of this phenomenon. This assumption is ultimately grounded on the underlying belief in a common way of living, referred to as "conviviality." The potential for future artificial agents to fulfill these requirements is disproven based on the principles of embodied and enactive cognition, which connect subjectivity and consciousness to the vitality of an organism. Even if subjectivity is fundamentally unattainable for artificial agents, the differentiation between simulated and genuine subjectivity may still become less clear. In this discussion, we specifically examine potential outcomes, with a particular focus on the utilization of virtual psychotherapy as an illustrative case. Ultimately, the study argues in favor of adopting a thoughtful approach when discussing artificial systems and emphasizes the importance of avoiding a deliberate pretense of subjectivity.
