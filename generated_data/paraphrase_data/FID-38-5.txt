In recent years, artificial intelligence has become an indispensable component of both production and service systems, as technology has become an essential feature of everyday life. Automated driving vehicles, commonly referred to as driverless cars, function automatically without the need for a human driver. Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the field of autonomous vehicles. The civilization currently need artificially intelligent autonomous automobiles. While there may be individuals who are hesitant to relinquish control of their vehicle to a computer, automated driving technologies possess the capacity to enhance road safety. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to tackle both environmental concerns and safety difficulties. Computers do not experience the same challenges as humans in maintaining focus while driving. Moreover, through proper responses, an autonomous vehicle has the ability to avert accidents caused by potentially hazardous situations on the road. Self-driving technology has numerous benefits, including increased accessibility to transportation for individuals who are unable to operate a vehicle. Due to factors such as lack of experience, disability, or advanced age, a significant number of individuals are unable to operate a motor vehicle. These individuals can travel with a significantly higher level of safety and autonomy. Consequently, this chapter will delve into the structures of both the software and hardware components of autonomous cars, along with their constituent parts, advantages, and forthcoming advancements.
