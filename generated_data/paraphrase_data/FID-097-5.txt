Immersive video games offer a realistic learning environment for agriculture by imitating challenging real-life events. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of actual information regarding their usefulness. This scoping review adheres to the PRISMA-ScR principles in order to provide a concise summary of the existing literature on serious video games used for agricultural learning. The review aims to identify research trends and pinpoint areas where further investigation is needed. We conducted a comprehensive search across nine significant research databases to identify publications on the use of serious video games for agricultural learning. The search was limited to papers published from January 2000 to July 2022. Two autonomous reviewers performed screening, data extraction, and synthesized the acquired data using a narrative technique. Out of the 3,297 papers initially found, only 0.58% (n = 19) were selected for the review. The majority of the games that received reviews were launched within the past five years, with a significant focus on the mobile platform. Their preferred method was a simulation-based technique, utilizing 2-D graphics and specifically tailored for individual players. The primary audience for these games is students, with a specific emphasis on agricultural production and sustainable agriculture. The studies frequently lacked specificity in their treatment of educational theories. The evaluation protocols largely focused on conducting pilot studies that emphasized the improvement of user experience and knowledge. The studies generally showed positive outcomes, including enhanced user experiences, increased knowledge, and changes in attitude and behavior. This study emphasizes the progress made in utilizing serious video games for agricultural education over a span of 20 years. Nevertheless, it emphasizes the necessity for more investigation into the influence of game components on user experience and efficacy. It is crucial to develop games that cater to minority players and address unique agricultural concerns. Additionally, it is important to improve the theoretical underpinnings and learning methodologies in this field. Thorough research designs are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of games across short, medium, and extended periods of time.
