This paper proposes a cross-domain information fusion matrix decomposition algorithm to improve the accuracy of personalized recommendations in artificial intelligence recommendation systems, taking into account the difficulties associated with inter-domain information fusion and data sparsity in collaborative filtering algorithms. First, social network data and Douban movie ratings are gathered for the study. Levenshtein distance detection is used to eliminate duplicate scores in order to maintain data integrity, and natural language processing technology is used to extract keywords and subject information from social communications. Additionally, discrete user and movie information is converted into binary matrices using a novel thermal coding technique, and user relationships are converted into feature vectors using graph convolutional networks. The Ridge regularization technique is presented to progressively optimize possible feature vectors in order to avoid overfitting. Then, characteristics from various areas are integrated using weighted average and feature connection approaches. Additionally, the study creates tailored suggestion lists by merging user attributes with an item-based collaborative filtering algorithm. Cross-domain information fusion optimization is carried out in the paper's experimental stage on four popular mathematical matrix decomposition algorithms: latent factor model (LFM), non-negative matrix decomposition, singular value decomposition, and alternating least squares approach. These algorithms are contrasted with the non-fused method. With mean absolute error and root mean squared error decreasing by 12.8% and 13.2%, respectively, among the four methods, the results show a notable increase in score accuracy. Additionally, the ranking accuracy coverage of the LFM method grows by 54.2% and the average F1 score reaches 0.97 when k = 10. Overall, there are noticeable benefits in terms of accuracy, prediction performance, recommendation diversity, and ranking quality when the mathematical matrix decomposition technique is paired with cross-domain information fusion. Additionally, the recommendation system's accuracy and variety are enhanced. Through the integration of many strategies, it successfully addresses collaborative filtering difficulties and greatly outperforms standard models in terms of suggestion variety and accuracy.
