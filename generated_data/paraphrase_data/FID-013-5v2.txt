Artificial intelligence (AI) technology covers a broad range of fields. AI-based technologies, both cooperative and individual, are widely available. Computer vision technology is one of them. Artificial neural networks, deep learning, machine learning, and other technologies are also connected to computer vision. Applications for computer vision may be found in many fields. The healthcare industry is one of the fields where it has been extensively used recently. Different algorithms from the aforementioned technologies are employed in the healthcare industry to extract valuable information from medical photos. This chapter provides an overview of computer vision, including its definition, domains of use, and use in healthcare. Additionally, a MATLAB environment example of computer vision-based tumor identification is taken into consideration.
