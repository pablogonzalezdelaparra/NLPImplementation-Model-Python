This paper conducts a preliminary investigation into the expression of emotions and the communication of information in English text. It categorizes the expression of emotions and the communication of information in English text based on the relationship between human emotions and values. Furthermore, it outlines the distinctive features of English emotion expression and information communication. Furthermore, the proposal suggests utilizing artificial intelligence technology to develop an analytical model for English text emotion and information transmission. This will be achieved by employing the BiLSTM neural network. In order to efficiently handle the attributes of English text, it is essential to encode the emotional information of the text. By utilizing the BiLSTM neural network, the emotional features of English text can be extracted and the issue of emotional feature loss can be addressed through the implementation of a loss function. Next, the crawler tool is utilized to acquire the dataset from the Chinese English module within the MOOC of Chinese universities. The evaluation indexes are established based on the model's performance, and subsequently, the English text's emotional expression and information conveyance are analyzed through experimentation. The findings indicate that the BiLSTM-based neural network outperforms the original CNN, LSTM, and T-LSTM in the task of text emotion expression and information conveyance. The accuracy rate consistently remains above 0.925. Additionally, the impact on the English dataset is slightly superior to that on the Chinese dataset. The objective of this study is to improve the instruction of the English language and facilitate effective communication between Chinese and international cultures.
