Advancements in technology have allowed computers to analyze and classify facial expressions in order to ascertain an individual's emotional state in a still image or a video. Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a widely studied topic in computer vision. Lately, deep facial expression recognition (FER) systems have mainly focused on tackling two major obstacles: the issue of overfitting caused by a lack of sufficient training data, and the existence of expression-unrelated changes, such as lighting conditions, head position, image quality, and bias towards specific individuals. This study presents a thorough examination of deep Facial Expression Recognition (FER), covering the techniques and datasets that provide valuable information about these inherent challenges. This work begins by providing a comprehensive timeline that illustrates the progression of techniques and datasets used in deep facial expression recognition (FER). This timeline demonstrates the evolution and advancement of the methodologies and data sources employed in Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Next, this paper presents a thorough examination of Facial Expression Recognition (FER) methods, encompassing the fundamental principles of FER such as preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, and various techniques. The review spans from the traditional era of FER, which relied on manually crafted features like SVM and HOG, to the current era of deep learning. Furthermore, a concise overview is given about the benchmark datasets, which may be classified into two categories: controlled environments (lab) and uncontrolled environments (in the wild). These datasets are utilized to assess various facial expression recognition (FER) approaches, as well as to compare different FER models. The paper discusses the current deep neural networks and training methodologies used for Facial Expression Recognition (FER), focusing on both static photos and dynamic image sequences. The text identifies the remaining obstacles and the related possibilities in Facial Expression Recognition (FER), as well as the future paths for creating resilient deep FER systems.
