The controller maintains maximum potential energy conversation to operate the pimping system at nominal conditions. Fuzzy logic intelligent controllers are successfully suitable and applicable in engineering and applied science. Climate changes have a direct impact on the performance of photovoltaic (PV). In order to maximize energy production in a variety of weather conditions, this paper aims to present an experimental approach for the implementation of fuzzy logic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) with boost converter based on an Arduino Mega micro-controller. This approach will be applied to a small-scale pumping system for water and chemical fluid analyses in an isolated area. Twenty (W) solar photovoltaic (PV) panels power the system. The MATLAB/Simulink fuzzy logic method for real-time control and monitoring of MPPT applications is presented in this paper. It makes use of an inexpensive Arduino Mega micro-controller along with (LV25, LP55) sensors to control a boost converter that is connected to a plastic pump and solar panel.
