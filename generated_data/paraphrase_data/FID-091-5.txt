Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is an effective empirical search method used for agent decision-making. It is particularly successful when combined with Deep Learning (DL) in mastering board games that were previously considered unbeatable. However, real-time video games do not seem to achieve the same level of success. This is because these games have a time restriction for exploration, which is a critical aspect. They are primarily meant for human users and therefore demand a substantial number of resources for simulation. In this research, we provide a surrogate-assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that is designed for commercial real-time video games. Our strategy involves using a deep-learning-based surrogate model to approximate the outcome of gameplay. Our work's main contribution lies in the development of a customized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm specifically tailored for real-time commercial video games. Our work can be seen as exploring a domain that previous research have not addressed, as commercial video games offer more intricate and dynamic gameplay to meet the demands of its consumers compared to non-commercial games. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach by performing a comparative experiment with different algorithms, including the conventional MCTS, within the context of a commercial real-time video game.
