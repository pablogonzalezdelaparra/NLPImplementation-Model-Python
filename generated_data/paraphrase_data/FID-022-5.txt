Advancements in technology have allowed computers to accurately detect and classify facial expressions in order to ascertain an individual's emotional state in a still image or a video. Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has emerged as a highly prominent study field in computer vision. Lately, deep facial expression recognition (FER) systems have mainly focused on tackling two major obstacles: the issue of overfitting caused by a lack of sufficient training data, and the existence of expression-unrelated changes such as lighting conditions, head position, image quality, and biases related to individual identities. This work presents a thorough examination of deep facial expression recognition (FER), including an analysis of techniques and datasets that provide valuable information about these inherent challenges. This study begins by providing a comprehensive chronology that illustrates the development of techniques and datasets in the field of deep facial expression recognition (FER). This timeline depicts the advancement and evolution of the methodologies and data sources employed in Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Next, a thorough examination of Facial Expression Recognition (FER) methods is presented, encompassing the fundamental principles of FER (such as preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, etc.) spanning from the era of traditional methods utilizing manually designed features (e.g., SVM and HOG) to the era of deep learning. Additionally, a concise overview is given about the benchmark datasets, which are divided into two categories: controlled environments (lab) and uncontrolled environments (in the wild). These datasets are utilized to assess various facial expression recognition (FER) approaches, and a comparison of different FER models is also shown. The paper discusses the current deep neural networks and training methods used for Facial Expression Recognition (FER), focusing on both static photos and dynamic image sequences. The text identifies the remaining obstacles and the related possibilities in Facial Expression Recognition (FER), as well as the future paths for creating strong and reliable deep FER systems.
