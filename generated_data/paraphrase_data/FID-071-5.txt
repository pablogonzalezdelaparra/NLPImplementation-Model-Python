This article examines the factors that contribute to technological disruptions in electrical systems and emphasizes various inherent drawbacks of protecting and automating components of electrical systems. The decline in the reliability of relay protection due to the shift from analog to digital protection systems is justified. The justification for employing fuzzy logic in protection systems is supported by the analysis of investigated examples. The practicality of incorporating fuzzy logic elements in protection devices and the automation of electrical systems for identifying different forms of short circuits are also substantiated. This article examines the prevalent forms of damage and shows the findings of simulating an electrical system with transformer coupling, in which various forms of asymmetrical short circuits were initiated. The behavior of the symmetrical components of short-circuit currents in the forward, reverse, and zero sequences is analyzed to understand their dynamics. Guidelines have been established to identify asymmetrical types of short circuits. A protection and automation operating algorithm utilizing fuzzy logic features has been created. The proposed algorithm for protection and automation will decrease the time required to identify the nature of the harm and activate protective measures.
