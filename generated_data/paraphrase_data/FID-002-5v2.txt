Over 30 nations have published national artificial intelligence (AI) policy strategies as of 2021. These publications usually address the social and ethical aspects of AI and lay forth plans and expectations for how it will affect policy areas, including education. This essay reviews the importance of education in the global AI policy debate while conducting a thematic analysis of 24 such national AI policy plans. It reveals that policy discussions mainly ignore the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education (AIED), but they heavily emphasize the need of education in producing a workforce prepared for AI and in producing more AI specialists. Furthermore, despite the importance of AI ethics debate generally in these texts, little emphasis is paid to the ethical implications of AIED. As this essay shows, successful policy and thorough examination of ethics are intimately connected. This implies that AIED and its larger policy and ethical implications—good or bad—have failed to penetrate popular consciousness and the agendas of important decision-makers. The paper uses a framework of five AI ethical principles to examine how policymakers may better take AIED's implications into account in light of these findings. In order to influence policy decisions for the public benefit, the paper concludes by providing advice for AIED scholars on how to participate in the policymaking process and conduct ethical and policy-focused AIED research.
