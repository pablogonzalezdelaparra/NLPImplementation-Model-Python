This paper presents a study that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to apply computer vision algorithms for identifying human emotions in video recordings while users interact with various visual stimuli. The research seeks to reveal the development of software that can detect emotions by utilizing AI algorithms and image processing pipelines to recognize users' facial expressions. The procedure entails evaluating users using visual stimuli and facilitating the application of computer vision algorithms that are in line with psychology theories that define emotions and their discernible characteristics. The study showcases the viability of using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and software development and training based on facial expressions to accurately identify emotions. The results demonstrate successful emotion detection. However, in order to enhance precision, further training is required for settings that involve a wider range of images and the implementation of additional algorithms to differentiate closely related emotional patterns. The discussion and conclusions highlight the inherent capabilities of artificial intelligence. The utilization of computer vision algorithms in emotion detection offers valuable insights into software development, continuous training, and the dynamic nature of emotion identification technologies. Additional training is required for situations involving a wider range of photos, coupled with the development of more advanced algorithms that can accurately differentiate between facial expressions that closely resemble each other in terms of emotional patterns. This will improve the level of certainty and accuracy.
