The presence of different kinds of random perturbations in real-acting objects is a defining characteristic that lowers the quality of the control process and necessitates the application of contemporary intellectual technology methods to solve the problem of synthesizing control systems of structurally complex dynamic objects. This allows for the partial uncertainty and randomness properties to be used as a means of mitigating the influence of external factors. The theory of intelligent control is applied to analyze problems related to the synthesis of the automatic control system of dynamic objects in this article. Here, the neuro-fuzzy approximation of the control system is achieved at each discrete interval by the employment of a neural network based on radial-basis functions, enabling real-time modification of the regulator settings. The purpose of the radial basis function is to approximate functions that are specified implicitly as pattern sets. A genetic algorithm is used to configure the parameters of the neuro-fuzzy regulator, making the computation of the regulator's set parameters more efficient. The vector representation of the regulator's parameters makes it easier to apply them to multidimensional objects. A evolutionary algorithm was employed to find the ideal tuning parameters of the neuro-fuzzy regulator, which is characterized by strong convergence and the ability to identify global extrema. The potential to provide quality control of the dynamic object under random perturbations and ambiguity of input data explains the neuro-fuzzy regulator's efficacy.
