Artificial intelligence in the form of machine learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionize the twenty-first century. Growing dataset sizes and recent, quick advancements in the underlying architecture and techniques of computers have improved computer proficiency in many domains. These include operating a car, translating across languages, using chatbots, and outperforming humans at challenging board games like Go. Here, we go over the principles and techniques behind machine learning and highlight particular methods of optimization and learning. The uses of ML in medicine are then summarized. Specifically, we highlight recent diagnostic accomplishments—as well as cautions—in the areas of pathology, radiography, dermatology, and general microscopy.
