Face recognition plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications, including security, surveillance, and authentication. Many households have installed closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras for the purpose of enhancing safety and identifying individuals. The purpose of these CCTV cameras is to ensure safety and identify individuals who visit their homes. In a select highly protected locations, access for unknown intruders is severely restricted. This study focuses on a system that use machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to identify the face of an intruder through a surveillance camera. The specified design is effectively realized using the HOG feature extraction and SVM classification algorithms. It accurately classifies the faces in a video stream provided as input. The primary aim of this study is to identify individuals' faces in a video using a HOG feature extractor. The faces will then be classified using SVM, allowing the machine to distinguish between authorized personnel working for the business and potential intruders.
