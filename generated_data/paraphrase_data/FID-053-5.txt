This paper presents a study that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to apply computer vision algorithms for identifying human emotions in video recordings while users interact with various visual stimuli. The objective of the research is to develop software that can detect emotions by utilizing artificial intelligence algorithms and image processing pipelines to recognize face expressions of users. The procedure entails evaluating users using visual stimuli and facilitating the application of computer vision algorithms that are in line with psychology theories that define emotions and their discernible characteristics. The study showcases the practicability of using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and software development and training methods based on facial expressions to recognize emotions. The findings emphasize the successful identification of emotions. However, in order to enhance precision, it is necessary to provide further training for settings that involve a wider range of images and to develop additional algorithms that can differentiate closely related emotional patterns. The discussion and conclusions highlight the inherent capabilities of artificial intelligence. The utilization of computer vision algorithms in emotion detection allows for valuable insights into software development, continuous training, and the dynamic nature of emotion identification technologies. Additional training is required for situations involving a wider range of photos, coupled with the development of algorithms that can accurately differentiate between facial expressions that closely resemble one other in terms of emotional patterns. This will improve the level of certainty and accuracy.
