Autoimmune illnesses are long-lasting, complex ailments that include multiple factors. Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, enables the identification of patterns in patient data. These patterns can be utilized to forecast patient outcomes, leading to enhanced clinical care. In this study, we examined the application of machine learning techniques to tackle clinical issues related to autoimmune diseases. A systematic review was performed utilizing the MEDLINE, Embase, and Computers and Applied Sciences Complete databases. The publications considered relevant were those that contained the terms "machine learning" or "artificial intelligence" along with the search term(s) related to autoimmune illnesses in their title, abstract, or key phrases. Exclusion criteria: studies written in languages other than English, studies lacking real human patient data, studies published before 2001, studies that were not subjected to peer review, studies focusing on comorbidity research and review papers unrelated to autoimmune diseases. A total of 169 out of 702 studies satisfied the criteria for inclusion. Support vector machines and random forests were the predominant machine learning techniques employed. The most prevalent ML models utilized data pertaining to multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Only a tiny fraction of research (7.7% or 13 out of 169) incorporated multiple data types during the modeling procedure. 8.3% of the studies (14 out of 169) used cross-validation and a separate testing set to evaluate their models, which helps ensure more reliable results. It would be advantageous for the field to implement a standard procedure of validating, cross-validating, and independently testing machine learning models. Several models demonstrated excellent prediction performance in straightforward circumstances, such as classifying cases and controls. Future advancements may allow for the development of more sophisticated predictive models by integrating numerous forms of data.
