Although fuzzy inference systems (FISs) have been around for a while, applying them to high-dimensional situations is still a difficult undertaking. The product and minimum operators are the most commonly utilized T-norms for calculating firing strengths; the former is typically used due to its differentiability. Nevertheless, the numeric underflow problem affects the product T-norm for high-dimensional applications. In this work, we mainly address the issue related to high-dimensional FIS (HDFIS) design and the use of T-norms. We build an HDFIS, called HDFIS-prod, for the product T-norm that readily overcomes the numerical underflow issue. Our proposal for an adaptive dimension-dependent membership function (DMF) is the primary innovation. We have developed a method for the minimal T-norm based on an empirical discovery. This mechanism naturally handles super high-dimensional issues, and the outcome is another HDFIS called HDFIS-min. Tests are conducted on 18 datasets with feature dimensions ranging from 1024 to 120450 for both HDFIS-prod and HDFIS-min. The outcomes of the simulation show that they can both handle high-dimensional datasets with competitive performance.
