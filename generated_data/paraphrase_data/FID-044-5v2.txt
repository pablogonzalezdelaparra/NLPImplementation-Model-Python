The usage of chatbots and other interactive software agents in the field of health and well-being is growing. There is a greater requirement to comprehend agents' empathy in these applications, as users and agents converse interpersonally for interventions like comfort, coaching, or behavior modification. There are no tools available in the state-of-the-art right now to perform that. We require a specific definition of empathy in order to comprehend interactive software agents' empathetic capacities. There is no agreed-upon formal definition of empathy in the literature, despite the fact that several definitions are discussed. A formal definition, or ontology, of empathy is created based on a thorough assessment of the literature and a qualitative investigation of contemporary approaches to empathy in interactive agents for health and well-being. We demonstrate the formal definition's potential in a controlled user research by using it to gauge empathy in two cutting-edge chatbots for health and wellbeing, Replika and Wysa. Our results imply that our definition encapsulates the prerequisites for evaluating empathy in interactive agents as well as how it might identify and elucidate patterns in how empathy is perceived over time. The concept, implemented in Web Ontology Language (OWL), might be used as an automated tool to help computers identify empathy in interactions, whether the systems are intelligent systems evaluating the empathy of their interlocutors or interactive agents analyzing their own empathetic behavior.
