Currently, the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in industrial control, smart home, and other domains has garnered positive feedback. Nevertheless, AI technology necessitates specific computer performance criteria and also confronts challenges in network security, data analysis, human-computer interaction, and other areas. Currently, the visual platform of embedded systems has made significant progress in practical applications. However, its development has been greatly hindered by issues such as low overall development efficiency and unsteady system performance. This paper developed an AI-based EP Vision System (VS). The platform integrated embedded hardware design with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to achieve intelligent robot interaction and target detection capabilities. According to the test results, under identical conditions, students and experts had positive ratings of System X at rates of 83.5% and 90% respectively, whereas negative evaluations were reported at rates of 16.5% and 10% respectively. Nevertheless, their favorable assessment of System Y only represented 19% and 4%, whereas the unfavorable assessment accounted for 81% and 96%. The percentage of favorable assessment for System X was much more than that for System Y, suggesting that System X is capable of meeting the practical application needs and enhancing the efficiency of system recognition to some degree. The study demonstrated a direct correlation between artificial intelligence (AI) technology and emotional intelligence (EP) vs (VS).
