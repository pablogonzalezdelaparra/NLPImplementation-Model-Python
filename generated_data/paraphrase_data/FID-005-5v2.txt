Precision education is a new problem when combining artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and learning analytics to improve teaching quality and learning performance, as discussed by Stephen Yang in his ICCE 2019 keynote lecture (Yang, 2019). According to Lu et al. (2018), the purpose of precision education is to promptly identify students who are at-risk and offer them interventions based on their teaching and learning experiences. This special issue, which draws on the central idea of precision education, promotes a thorough discussion between cold technology and warm humanity in order to advance knowledge of precision education. Thirteen research papers specializing in machine learning, learning analytics, AI, and precision education were exchanged for this special issue in order to gain a deeper understanding of the application of AI in education. The papers covered a wide range of applications, methods, pedagogical models, and environments.
