Over the past few years, the scientific and academic community has been particularly interested in video games, specifically in studying and experimenting with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). AGI experimental systems enable the analysis and study of the behavior of various pre-defined AI agents in a visual manner. This work introduces a new game engine called GAGI, which can be used as a platform for experimenting with AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). GAGI, functioning as a game engine, possesses the capability to develop and produce innovative 2D and 3D video games by utilizing the C++ programming language. Furthermore, GAGI offers users a distinctive platform for simulating and analyzing AI agents within the game that they have designed. Users have the ability to deploy many AI agents and engage with them in real time, enhancing their comprehension of the agents' interactions and behaviors. The suggested software's features are compared to those of widely-used game engines in the video games industry and the research community, emphasizing its advantages in terms of design capability and AI support. GAGI also provides the opportunity to replicate the studies, hence expanding the range of possibilities for the research community.
