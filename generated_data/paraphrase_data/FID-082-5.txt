This paper provides a thorough examination of the existing body of literature on the study and implementation of machine learning (ML) methods in recommender systems (RS). The study's objective is to analyze current patterns, examine practical uses, and provide guidance to scholars in aligning their research endeavors in this field published between January and June of 2023. The findings are classified into many categories, such as education, healthcare, ML algorithms (namely auto-encoders and reinforcement learning), e-commerce, and digital journalism. The review emphasizes the improved precision of recommendations, greater ability to handle larger amounts of data, customization and understanding of context, various machine learning techniques, and approaches for dealing with new and sparse data. It also lays the groundwork for future developments in machine learning algorithms for recommendation systems, particularly in the context of manufacturing enterprises.
