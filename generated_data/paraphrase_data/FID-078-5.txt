The primary objective of this paper is to justify the methodological approach to evaluating personnel risks in enterprises by utilizing the fuzzy logic framework. This approach aims to identify issues related to personnel risk management and offer suitable recommendations for their resolution. The study is grounded on the established principles and essential works of both foreign and domestic scientists, statistical data, and our own research findings on the evaluation of human hazards in organizations. The study included many techniques including fuzzy set theory, comparative analysis, scientific abstraction, generalization of scientific experience, and a systematic and comprehensive methodology. The study presented a methodological methodology for evaluating the extent of people hazards in a company. Numerical experiments were carried out using a cohort of construction equipment manufacturers. The analysis of the results from assessing the level of personnel risks at enterprises has revealed the issues in managing personnel risks. The study focuses on hierarchical fuzzy data, specifically four groups of indicators for assessing the level of personnel risks: quantitative composition (F1), state of qualifications and intellectual potential (F2), staff turnover (F3), and motivational system (F4). Each indicator has a varying number of fuzzy coefficients, with twelve coefficients considered in this study (vi, i=1รท12). The indicators are defined as functions of fuzzy coefficients. F1 is determined by the values of v1, v2, and v3. F2 depends on the values of v4, v5, v6, and v7. F3 is calculated based on the values of v8, v9, and v10. Finally, F4 is determined by the values of v11 and v12. The output variable, Int, represents the personnel risk level and is determined by a functional relationship with the input variables F1, F2, F3, and F4. The personnel risk level is also expressed as a fuzzy value. The functions r, g, h, q, and f are unspecified functions of the provided variables. We possess proficient assessments of the modification in every input data, often categorized into three levels: Low (I), Medium (G), and High (E). The formalized information for each variable can be expressed as follows: . For a set of indicators, we can then state: . To utilize a fuzzy system and do computations using it, the system must possess the following structural components: membership functions for input and output variables, a rule base, and an output mechanism. The structural elements refer to the constituent parts that will be constructed during the construction of a fuzzy system. The developed mathematical model and its formalization using FST allow for the estimation of personnel risk levels at the firm, facilitating the justification of a range of measures to enhance its utilization efficiency. The developed fuzzy logical inference system can be regarded as intelligent since it incorporates components of computational intelligence, specifically the theory of fuzzy sets. The proposed methodology for evaluating personnel risks in enterprises, using fuzzy logic, offers a unique advantage over existing methods. It allows for the integration of both qualitative and quantitative indicators when assessing personnel risks and movement, leading to more effective decision-making in uncertain situations and reducing costs in adverse scenarios.
