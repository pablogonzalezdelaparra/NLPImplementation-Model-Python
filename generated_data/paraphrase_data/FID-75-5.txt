This study explores the complexities of adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control for nonholonomic multirobot systems that are defined by unlimited actuator faults and range limits. In order to tackle these problems, we make use of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and utilize adaptive techniques to estimate unfamiliar nonlinear functions and uncertain parameters that exist in robotic dynamics. During the process of exploring information, the challenges of avoiding collisions and maintaining connectedness are constantly present because of constraints in distance and visual perception. To address confined range obstacles effectively, we present a comprehensive barrier function and prescribed performance approach. In addition, robots minimize the number of controller executions and address any impact caused by infinite actuator failures by communicating with their leader when actuator faults occur. This communication is done using fewer network resources, while still ensuring uninterrupted tracking of the desired trajectory set by the leader. Using dynamic surface technology, we provide a decentralized adaptive event-triggering fault-tolerant (ETFT) formation control technique. All signals are guaranteed to be semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). In conclusion, we prove the practical possibility of implementing the ETFT control approach for nonholonomic multirobot systems.
