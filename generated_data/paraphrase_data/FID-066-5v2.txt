The remarkable powers of living things stem from the way their bodies manifest autonomy. Living things combine physical and computational intelligence through mechanical compliance, multifunctionality of materials, and bodily form across many sizes. Although the design and construction of physically intelligent bodies have evolved thanks to soft robotics, integrating information-processing skills for computational intelligence is still difficult. As a result, current soft robot design is limited by constraints related to perception and control. Deliberate convergence in the codevelopment of novel materials, manufacturing techniques, and control systems for soft robots will be necessary to advance toward untethered autonomy. Here, a novel viewpoint is presented: problems by themselves should be used by academics to impose material and information restrictions on the design of soft robots. To avoid the constraints imposed by control techniques, a task-first design paradigm is suggested along with a conceptual framework. With this approach, task-capable agents may easily take advantage of emergent synergies between material and information processing capabilities of soft matter. The scale dependency of solutions receives special attention. Lastly, a research view on new avenues for developing autonomy for future soft robots, from paramecia to elephant trunks in size, is given.
