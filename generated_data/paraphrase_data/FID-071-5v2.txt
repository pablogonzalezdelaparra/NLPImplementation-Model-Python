The reasons of technological disruptions in electrical systems are examined in this article, along with a number of distinctive drawbacks related to the automation and protection of electrical system components. It is proven that switching from analog to digital forms of protection has a tendency to make relay protection less reliable. The usage of fuzzy logic in safeguards, the practicality of including fuzzy logic components in protection devices, and the automation of electrical systems to recognize different kinds of short circuits are all supported by the examined cases. This article describes the findings of modeling an electrical system with transformer coupling, where all kinds of asymmetric short circuits were created, and examines the most typical damages. The forward, backward, and zero sequences' symmetrical short-circuit current changes and their corresponding dynamics are ascertained. There are established guidelines for recognizing asymmetric short circuit types. Using fuzzy logic components, an automation and protection method has been created. The time it takes to identify the kind of damage and activate safeguards will be shortened by the suggested protection and automation methodology.
