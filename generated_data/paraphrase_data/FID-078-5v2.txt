This paper's main idea is to validate a methodological approach to personnel risk assessment for businesses using fuzzy logic apparatus. The purpose of this approach is to identify personnel risk management issues and formulate recommendations for effective solutions. The classic guidelines and foundational works of both domestic and international scientists, statistical data, and the findings of our investigation into the challenges of evaluating human risks of businesses form the methodological basis of the study. Fuzzy set theory, comparative analysis, scientific abstraction, system complex approach, and the generalization of scientific experience of contemporary theoretical research were among the methodologies employed. The study offered a systematic framework for evaluating an organization's people risk level; numerical trials were carried out using a sample of construction equipment manufacturers. The work considers hierarchical fuzzy data, specifically: four groups of indicators for assessing the level of personnel risks (quantitative composition – F1, state of qualifications and intellectual potential – F2, staff turnover – F3, motivational system – F4). Each of the indicators has a different number of fuzzy coefficients (there are twelve of them in the current work – vi, i=1÷12). Analysis of the results of assessing the level of personnel risks of enterprises made it possible to identify the problems with managing personnel risks at enterprises. Functions of fuzzy coefficients make up the indicators: F1 = r(v1, v2, v3); F2 = g(v4, v5, v6, v7); F3 = h(v8, v9, v10,); F4 = q(v11, v12). The personnel risk level has a functional, integrated indicator Int = f(F1, F2, F3, F4) as an output variable. This indicator is also fuzzy. In this case, the functions r, g, h, q, and f of the supplied variables are unknown functions. All of the input data have been evaluated by experts, and their opinions generally fall into one of three categories: Low (I), Medium (G), or High (E). Each variable's formalized information may be expressed as, and given a set of indicators, we have. The following structural components of a fuzzy system are necessary for using and calculating with its assistance: an output mechanism, a rule base, and membership functions of input and output variables. The components that will be constructed while creating a fuzzy system are these structural parts. It is possible to evaluate the degree of people risk at the company thanks to the developed mathematical model and the way of formalizing it on the basis of FST. This allows for the further validation of a set of measures to improve the effectiveness of its usage. Because the developed fuzzy logical inference system makes use of computational intelligence components—specifically, the fuzzy set theory—it may be regarded as intelligent. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed methodological approach to evaluating the personnel risks of enterprises based on fuzzy logic apparatus allows to integrate the consideration of both qualitative and quantitative indicators when evaluating the personnel risks and personnel movement indicators. It also significantly increases the effectiveness of decision-making in uncertain situations and lowers costs when unfavorable circumstances arise.
