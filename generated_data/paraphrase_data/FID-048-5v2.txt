One particular moral quality of human behavior is empathy. A distinct set of behavioral and ethical factors, including human empathy, are brought into play by the global workplace and, therefore, when considering employee stakeholders. Furthermore, in corporate organizations, management oversight and human resources are responsible for the human side of the workplace. Therefore, everyday job-related expectations, interactions and practices between employees and employers, and the results of employees' work routines complicate human emotions and interactions. Risk management procedures, human resources, and business ethics are all commonplace in the workplace. The knowledge of models of AI-dependent business practices is beginning to highlight how important it is to take into account the ethical implications of AI's effects on workers in the workplace. Beyond a compliance perspective, this study examines the benefits and hazards of AI ideation, development, and deployment in business-employee interactions practices via a systematic ethical lens and presents additional workplace concerns. Empathy is interested in the motivations of others. Because of this, attributional ethical recommendations about the use of AI in the workplace and its effects on workers are required. Furthermore, this study applies a cognitive empathy perspective to examine artificial morality in relation to ethical issues, ramifications, and workplace practices surrounding the development, use, and practices of AI that may have an influence on workers in a range of business domains.
