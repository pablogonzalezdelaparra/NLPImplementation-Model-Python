In the process of creating technology that is more sensitive and compassionate, human-AI interaction has gained significant attention. Because artificial empathy techniques have the potential to improve both the emotive and social aspects of consumer encounters, they are particularly interesting in this context. This study is to investigate how artificial empathy techniques might be applied to optimize human-AI interactions, hence enhancing emotional and social consumer experiences. The qualitative research methodology involves a study of relevant literature and a number of investigations. Books, journals, and articles that are pertinent to the study topic are the data sources that are employed. The application of artificial empathy techniques in human-AI interactions has a significant potential to enhance the caliber of interactions and consumer experiences, according to the research findings. Artificial intelligence (AI) can react to human requirements and emotions more accurately and sensitively by utilizing technologies like sentiment analysis, emotion identification, and natural language processing.
