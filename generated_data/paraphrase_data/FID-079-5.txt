Real-world objects exhibit random perturbations that negatively impact the control process. To address this issue, modern methods of intelligent technology are used to design control systems for complex dynamic objects. These methods aim to compensate for the effects of external factors that possess random and partially uncertain properties. The paper discusses the synthesis of automatic control systems for dynamic objects using intelligent control theory. In this scenario, a neural network that relies on radial-basis functions is employed at every distinct interval to approximate the control system using neuro-fuzzy techniques. This enables the regulator settings to be adjusted in real-time. The radial basis function is specifically designed to provide an approximation for functions that are defined in the implicit form of pattern sets. The parameter configuration of the neuro-fuzzy regulator is achieved by the utilization of a genetic algorithm, which allows for more efficient calculation in order to determine the set parameters of the regulator. The parameters of the regulator are expressed as a vector, which makes it easier to apply them to objects with many dimensions. A evolutionary algorithm was employed to identify the ideal tuning parameters of the neuro-fuzzy regulator, which is known for its strong convergence and ability to detect global extrema. The neuro-fuzzy regulator is effective because it can provide quality control for a dynamic object even when there are random disturbances and ambiguity in the input data.
