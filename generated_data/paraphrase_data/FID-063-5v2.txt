This research looks at the ethical issues and legal framework around artificial intelligence (AI) in terms of data integrity and how it affects social dynamics. Primary data was gathered from 650 AI practitioners in a variety of industries, including developers, data scientists, ethicists, and policymakers, using a cross-sectional survey technique. The efficacy of AI deployment and data integrity were examined, along with the relationships between regulatory compliance, ethical awareness, professional training, and expertise in AI practice. The results showed a significant positive association between perceived efficacy in using AI and greater levels of regulatory compliance as well as between data integrity assurance and awareness of AI ethics. Furthermore, a strong correlation was found between professional AI training and the improvement of social dynamics. Despite having a favorable correlation, expertise in the field of artificial intelligence had a lesser association with data integrity, suggesting that experience alone is not enough to guarantee good AI practices. The research emphasizes the significance of professional training, legal frameworks, and ethical issues in influencing AI development and its social ramifications. It is highlighted that dynamic, flexible, and inclusive regulatory frameworks are necessary in order to bring AI techniques into compliance with ethical standards and social values. Future avenues for investigation include the influence of developing technologies like quantum computing on AI ethics as well as the ethics and governance of AI in various cultural contexts.
