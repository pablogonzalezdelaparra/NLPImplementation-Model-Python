This article explores a solution to address the significant challenges associated with controlling induction machines, with the aim of achieving exceptional dynamic performance. Conventional direct torque control and indirect control with flux orientation suffer from certain limitations, including the presence of current harmonics, torque ripples, flux ripples, and extended rising time. This article presents a comparison analysis of earlier methodologies and the one that use fuzzy logic. The simulation results demonstrate that the utilization of fuzzy logic in the direct torque control approach yields superior performance by delivering accurate and rapid responses without any overshooting. Additionally, it effectively reduces fluctuations in both torque and flux at low switching frequencies. The showcased enhancements in dynamic performance enhance operational efficiency and reliability in industrial applications.
