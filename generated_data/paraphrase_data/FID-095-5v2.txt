Precise scientific fields like as biomechanics, genetics, ethology, and neurology depend on precisely following animal behavior throughout research, especially when markers are not used. But extracting exact views from constantly changing surroundings has proven to be challenging. We just released an open-source toolbox that uses a state-of-the-art human position estimation method. This toolkit allows users to train a deep neural network to track features with an accuracy close to human labeling, even for user-defined characteristics. To this updated Python package, we have included new features such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs), performance gains, and network refinement based on active learning. To assist clients in developing a distinct and replicable analytical pipeline through the utilization of a graphics processing unit (GPU).
