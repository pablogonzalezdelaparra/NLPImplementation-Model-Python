The complexity of adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control for nonholonomic multirobot systems with unlimited actuator defects and range limits is explored in this research. In order to tackle these problems, we utilize the capabilities of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and apply adaptive techniques to estimate uncertain parameters and nonlinear functions that are prevalent in robotic dynamics. Due to restrictions on distance and visual fields, collision avoidance and connection maintenance are constant issues throughout information exploration. To successfully address confined range obstructions, we therefore develop a generic barrier function and recommended performance technique. In addition, in order to minimize the quantity of controller executions and offset the impact of infinite actuator failures, robots communicate with their leader during actuator failures by utilizing fewer network communication resources while continuing to track the intended trajectory that the leader has generated. We suggest a decentralized adaptive event-triggering fault-tolerant (ETFT) formation control approach with the use of dynamic surface technology. All of the signals are guaranteed to be semi-global, uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). In the end, we show that the ETFT control method for nonholonomic multirobot systems is practically feasible.
