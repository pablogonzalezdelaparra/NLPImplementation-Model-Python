Drug design and development is a crucial field of study for pharmaceutical businesses and chemical researchers. Nevertheless, the obstacles of low effectiveness, inaccurate distribution, lengthy process, and exorbitant expenses provide significant problems that affect the development and exploration of new drugs. In addition, the drug discovery pipeline is hindered by the inclusion of intricate and extensive data from genomes, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are essential in the process of drug discovery and development. Artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have revolutionized the field. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been utilized in various drug discovery procedures, including peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure–activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. The historical evidence bolsters the integration of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this domain. In addition, advanced data mining, curation, and management strategies have played a crucial role in supporting the development of new modeling algorithms. To summarize, the progress made in artificial intelligence and deep learning presents a promising chance to enhance the rational medication design and discovery process, ultimately benefiting humanity.
