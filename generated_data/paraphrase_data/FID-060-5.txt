Tumor segmentation in breast ultrasound (US) pictures is a crucial concern in the field of medical imaging. The segmentation and categorization of abnormalities pose challenges for even experienced radiologists due to the subpar quality of US pictures and the diverse specifications of US machines. The research presents a new AI-based hybrid model for US segmentation that achieves high accuracy, uses minimal datasets, and can handle unfamiliar data. This program is suitable for performing diagnostics and conducting US-guided biopsies. An innovative and resilient hybrid methodology that integrates deep learning (DL) and multi-agent artificial life (AL) has been presented. The algorithms are validated using three datasets from the United States. The solution surpasses 14 chosen cutting-edge algorithms when applied to US photos with intricate geometry and a significant amount of noise. The research presents a novel categorization of the photos and conducts experiments to assess the boundaries of deep learning. The model has undergone training and validation using a dataset consisting of 1264 ultrasound pictures. The photos are stored in the JPEG and PNG file formats. The patients' ages span from 22 to 73 years. The set of 14 benchmark algorithms encompasses deformable forms, edge linking, superpixels, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies. The evaluations employ eight-region measures that assess shape and contour. The proposed method, DL-AL, achieves outstanding results in terms of the dice coefficient (region) and the relative Hausdorff distance H3 (contour-based). Specifically, for images with the easiest complexity level, the dice coefficient is 0.96 and the Hausdorff distance is 0.26. For images with medium complexity, the dice coefficient is 0.91 and the Hausdorff distance is 0.82. Lastly, for images with the hardest complexity level, the dice coefficient is 0.90 and the Hausdorff distance is 0.84. All other measures exhibit a consistent pattern. The DL-AL surpasses the second best method (based on Unet) by a margin of 10-20%. The approach has also undergone a range of non-traditional examinations. The model underwent training using images of low complexity and was subsequently applied to the whole dataset of images. The following is a summary of these outcomes. (1) The training process only utilized images with minimal complexity, with 68% of the images being unknown. The performance metrics for this training were a Dice score of 0.80 and an H3 score of 2.01. (2) The training process included low and medium complexity images, with 51% of them being unknown. The evaluation metrics for these images were Dice = 0.86 and H3 = 1.32. (3) The training process utilized images of several difficulty levels, including low, medium, and hard. Approximately 35% of the images used were unknown. The performance metrics for this training process were a Dice coefficient of 0.92 and an H3 score of 0.76. The tests demonstrate a notable superiority of DL-AL compared to 30%.
