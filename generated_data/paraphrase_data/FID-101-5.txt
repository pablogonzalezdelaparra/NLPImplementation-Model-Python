Thanks to the remarkable progress in data aggregation and deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are on the verge of revolutionizing the field of medicine. The discipline of orthopedics is well-suited to use the potential of big data, which can offer valuable insights to enhance various aspects of care delivered by orthopedic surgeons. This review aims to assess the latest and innovative literature on machine learning (ML) in the field of orthopedics and its potential implications for the future of musculoskeletal care.
