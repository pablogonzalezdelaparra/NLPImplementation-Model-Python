This essay discusses the current developments in artificial intelligence and the growing interest in it in the media. Eliezer Yudkowsky, a prominent player in the field of artificial intelligence alignment, is given significant attention in an effort to close the knowledge gap between the general public's and rationalist perspectives on AI technology. In this emphasis, his proposed artificial intelligence plan of action—described in his unpublished document AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities—is analyzed. This is accomplished by making an effort to comprehend the idea of intelligence itself and coming up with a practical definition that makes sense. The idea of intelligence is then used to analyze the capabilities and advancements of modern artificial intelligence in order to determine how applicable it is to these technologies. According to this research, there is some intelligence present in modern artificial intelligence systems. Nevertheless, it challenges the ideas of artificial intelligence alignment and calls into question the veracity of Nick Bostrom's Orthogonality Thesis by arguing that both powerful and weak artificial intelligence systems, devoid of human-defined goals, would not inherently pose existential threats to humanity. Additionally, the prospect of creating artificial life by combining several modules that each simulate a certain mental function is explored.
