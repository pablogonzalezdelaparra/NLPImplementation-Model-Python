A critical problem arose in Delhi, India, during the COVID-19 pandemic: almost 1,500 patients who tested positive for the virus vanished. Hospital management finds it challenging to keep track of patients during public health emergencies, such as pandemics, natural disasters, or other calamities, when there is a sudden surge in patient volume. This is particularly true when patients need to be transferred between facilities or when new temporary healthcare facilities need to be established. These difficulties may lead to a rise in situations involving missing persons. Unintentionally separating patients from their relatives is a possibility. The human face is a special kind of biometric information that may be used to verify identify and detect an individual's age, gender, and even mood. Patient identification is a critical application of computer vision that harnesses the potential of artificial intelligence and deep learning. In this study, we have proposed a state-of-the-art patient face detection model using a twofold model that uses FaceNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a well-known face embedding algorithm, as a face embedding algorithm and MTCNN, short for "multi-task cascaded convolution neural network," for face detection and alignment purposes. Finally, we use KNN algorithm as a classifier to get an accuracy of 97.1%. Additionally, in order to guarantee public safety during the pandemic, we have established a 97% accurate Resnet34 mask identification model, which was trained on the Face Mask identification dataset. This work has ramifications for wider healthcare applications in addition to addressing the pressing issues of patient identification and safety in emergency situations. The suggested approaches present viable ways to improve security and patient care.
