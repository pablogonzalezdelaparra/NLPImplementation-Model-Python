The chronic, complex disorders known as autoimmune diseases. Finding patterns in medical data and using them to forecast patient outcomes for better clinical care is achievable using machine learning (ML), a subfield of artificial intelligence. Here, we reviewed the use of machine learning techniques to autoimmune disease clinical issues. MEDLINE, embase, and the whole databases for computers and applied sciences were used to conduct a systematic review. "Artificial intelligence" or "machine learning" together with the search term(s) for autoimmune disorders in the title, abstract, or key phrases were included in pertinent publications. Exclusion criteria included publications before 2001, non-autoimmune disease comorbidity research and review papers, studies not written in English, and no genuine human patient data. Out of 702 studies, 169 satisfied the inclusion criteria. The most widely utilized machine learning techniques were random forests and support vector machines. The most prevalent ML models used data on inflammatory bowel illness, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Only a little percentage of research (7.7%, or 13/169) integrated several forms of data during the modeling procedure. In 8.3% of publications (14/169), cross-validation was supplemented with an additional testing set for a more thorough model assessment. Adopting best practices for ML model validation, cross-validation, and independent testing may be beneficial for the discipline. In straightforward circumstances, several models produced good prediction outcomes (e.g., categorization of cases and controls). Future advancements in prediction model complexity might be attained by integrating various data kinds.
