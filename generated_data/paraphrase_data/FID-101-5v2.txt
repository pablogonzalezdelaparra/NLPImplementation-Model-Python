Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have the potential to revolutionize medical treatment due to the unparalleled progress in data aggregation and deep learning algorithms. Particularly in the area of orthopedics, big data may be leveraged to enhance the many aspects of treatment that orthopedic surgeons give by offering vital insights. This review's objectives are to critically assess the most current and innovative orthopedics literature on machine learning (ML) and discuss how it can affect musculoskeletal treatment in the future.
