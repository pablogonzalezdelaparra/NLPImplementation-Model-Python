This study aimed to examine the level of empathy displayed during interactions between human participants and chatbots among computer science students at Uppsala University, Sweden. This study investigated participants' perceptions of anthropomorphic chatbots as either machines or humans, the occurrence of verbal abuse in human-chatbot encounters, and the influence of gender dynamics on expectations of chatbot helpfulness. A qualitative data collection was carried out using a semi-structured interview style including five students. The data was evaluated manually using thematic analysis. The study's findings indicate that empathy exists in human chatbot interaction, irrespective of participants' perception of anthropomorphic chatbots as either humans or computers. Nevertheless, the overall level of empathy tends to be low as participants become frustrated when they are displeased with the chatbot's response. They often depart the chatbot without expressing their frustration and subsequently forget about it, returning at a later time with different queries. The study additionally demonstrates that participants anticipate greater assistance and courtesy when chatbots are more inclined to possess feminine characteristics.
