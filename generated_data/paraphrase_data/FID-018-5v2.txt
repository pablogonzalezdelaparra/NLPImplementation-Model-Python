A typical high-tech comprehensive application is an autonomous vehicle, which uses technologies such as computer vision, sensors, information fusion, information communication, high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, automatic control, and others to perform tasks like scene perception, optimization calculations, multi-level assisted driving, and other tasks. In these technologies, computer vision plays a crucial role in autonomous driving as a direct input point to data processing. Secondly, it introduces innovative modifications to the transportation system of the future. Intelligent decision-making and control in autonomous driving are made possible in large part by the use of image processing and computer vision in the vehicle's perception and understanding of its surroundings. This paper explains image processing technology in automatic driving, including camera and sensor technology, image acquisition and preprocessing, feature extraction, and object detection, in order to discuss the application of computer vision algorithms in automatic driving. This is done in addition to the application of computer vision and artificial intelligence in automated driving. Research on traffic signal and sign recognition, obstacle detection and avoidance, and lane maintaining and recognition is extremely important from a practical standpoint.
