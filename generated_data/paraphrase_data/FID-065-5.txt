This article explores the recent progress and growing media coverage of artificial intelligence. Eliezer Yudkowsky, a prominent player in the field of artificial intelligence alignment, is dedicated to bridging the gap between public views and rationalist viewpoints on artificial intelligence technology. This analysis examines his anticipated plan of action for artificial intelligence as described in his unpublished document titled "AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities." This is accomplished by striving to comprehend the notion of intelligence itself and establishing a practical and logical definition of that concept. The concept of intelligence is then employed to analyze the relevance of modern artificial intelligence capabilities and advancements to these technologies. This study concludes that current artificial intelligence systems possess a certain degree of intelligence. Nevertheless, it contends that artificial intelligence systems, whether weak or strong, that lack human-defined objectives, would not inherently present existential risks to humanity. This challenges the concept of aligning artificial intelligence and raises doubts about the validity of Nick Bostrom's Orthogonality Thesis. Moreover, the potential for generating synthetic life by combining several modules, each simulating a distinct cognitive function, is being examined.
