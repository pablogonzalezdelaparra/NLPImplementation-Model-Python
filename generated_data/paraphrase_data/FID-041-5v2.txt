Empathy computing is a new area of study that combines big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to anticipate, detect, mimic, and create empathy in people. This discipline uses cutting-edge computing techniques to analyze and simulate empathy, building on psychology research in terms of ideas, measurements, brain underpinnings, and applications of empathy. In order to facilitate foundational research and useful applications in this field, this article critically reviews current research on empathy computing and discusses its future directions from a psychological perspective. Based on different purposes and methods, the current research on empathy computing can be categorized into four themes. On the one hand, the main goal of empathy computing is to use computers to evaluate and understand empathy. This attempt may be further subdivided into two categories: (1) empathetic content categorization, which focuses on evaluating empathetic qualities in texts rather than humans, and (2) individual empathy evaluation, which analyzes individual empathetic attributes. However, research is also focused on using computers to simulate and express empathy. Examples of this include the creation of generative empathetic conversation systems and empathetic response systems (3) and (4). The latter uses AI to automatically construct a large range of sympathetic dialogues without relying on predetermined rules, while the former gives users a limited number of predefined rule-based replies and feedback to exhibit empathy. Despite being mostly separate, these four study areas are complimentary. Furthermore, as research advances, new avenues for investigation will keep coming up, like enhancing computers' capacity for empathy via brain-computer interface technology. Although empathy computing research is still in its infancy, it has already demonstrated promise for ground-breaking applications in areas like public management, education, mental health, and business services. These sectors, which entail a great deal of interpersonal connection, are poised to become the key areas of human-computer interaction as artificial intelligence becomes more and more common. Consequently, these become the main use cases for empathy computing. Empathy computing can help automatically assess and improve therapists' empathy levels in the field of mental health. Through AI-driven chatbots, it may also offer individualized, sympathetic assistance and direction. Empathy computing in education can help students learn more effectively by using AI tutors that are sympathetic. In the business domain, it facilitates the provision of customized client experiences by enterprises, which in turn raises consumer happiness and cultivates loyalty by generating sympathetic conversations. Empathy computing can be applied in public management to provide sympathetic conversation in response to disparaging remarks. Furthermore, it makes it easier for decision-makers to react to the demands and questions of the public with empathy, which promotes public-government confidence. These four examples show how empathy computing may be used in a wide range of situations. But it is now impractical to rely only on computers to carry out compassionate duties because of safety and ethical issues. Rather, human-computer cooperation is required. Empathy computing is a revolutionary field that not only offers automated techniques for measuring and analyzing empathy on a broader scale but also enhances the theoretical framework of empathy research. By examining its new expressions in human-AI connections, it expands on earlier research on empathy in interpersonal relationships. The subject of empathy's universality and possible progression in human-computer connection is brought up by this extension. A comprehensive theory of empathy that covers a wide range of relationship dynamics, from human-human to human-machine interactions and beyond, might potentially be built around empathy computing. Future research should concentrate on creating integrated theoretical models of empathy computing, establishing trustworthy psychological and behavioral datasets of empathy-related characteristics, and validating and improving empathy computing research using a human-centered approach. This will help us fully understand empathy and effectively promote it in the context of an intelligent society. In this sector, psychologists are essential for guiding, assessing, and improving practice and research. It is crucial for researchers in computer science and psychology to work together to make sure AI develops empathy in a morally and practically sound manner, which will promote people's well-being in the future intelligent society.
