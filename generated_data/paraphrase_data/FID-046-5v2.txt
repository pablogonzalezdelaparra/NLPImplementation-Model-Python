With the world becoming more and more dependent on AI systems, contentious applications of AI that have a big impact on people's lives are becoming more plausible. As a result, raising awareness of AI prejudice that may harm disadvantaged populations is harder. We conducted a laboratory study in which participants were presented with a biased Wizard of Oz AI while embodying personas that varied widely in their ability to achieve high financial credit scores due to their age and gender. This was done because it has been demonstrated previously that virtual reality increases empathy through immersive perspective-taking. In contrast to a baseline condition in which they believed themselves to be these characters, we discovered that participants assuming personas in virtual reality felt substantially greater empathy toward the characters they embodied and assessed the AI as significantly less fair. In addition, we explore distinctions across embodied personas and deliberate on qualitative findings to acquire understanding of the participants' mental model construction.
