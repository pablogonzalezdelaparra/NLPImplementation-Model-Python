Fuzzy inference systems (FISs) have been developed over an extended period, although employing FISs for high-dimensional issues remains a formidable undertaking. The most commonly employed T-norms for calculating the firing strengths are the product and minimum operators, with the former being favored due to its differentiability. However, in the case of high-dimensional issues, the product T-norm is susceptible to the issue of numeric underflow. Our main goal is to address the issue related to the utilization of T-norms in the construction of high-dimensional Fuzzy Inference Systems (HDFISs). To address the issue of numeric underflow, we create an HDFIS (Hierarchical Decision Fuzzy Inference System) called HDFIS-prod, specifically designed for the T-norm product operation. The primary innovation is in our proposal of an adaptive dimension-dependent membership function (DMF). Based on empirical observation, we have developed a technique called HDFIS-min that effectively handles super high-dimensional issues by utilizing the minimum T-norm. Both HDFIS-prod and HDFIS-min undergo testing on 18 datasets, with feature dimensions ranging from 1024 to 120450. The simulation findings indicate that both of them exhibit comparable performance in managing datasets with a large number of dimensions.
