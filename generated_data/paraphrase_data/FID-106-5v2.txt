Innovation and adaptation are critical to the industrial sector. New technologies should enable sustainable production as a result of this advancement. Global perspectives on smart production application technologies are necessary to advance sustainability through smart production. In order to achieve sustainable manufacturing, a variety of AI-based approaches, including machine learning, have already been created in the sector owing to significant research efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, the current study set out to conduct a thorough analysis of the scientific literature about the industrial applications of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). In reality, with the advent of Industry 4.0, machine learning and artificial intelligence are seen as the main forces behind the transformation in smart factories. Classifying the literature by publication year, authors, scientific sector, nation, institution, and keywords was the aim of this review. The SCOPUS database and Web of Science were used for the analysis. Moreover, NVivo 12 and UCINET software were utilized to finish them. In order to show how the field has changed from 1999 to the present, a study of the literature on ML and AI empirical investigations produced in the past century was done. Eighty-two papers underwent classification and evaluation. The first noteworthy outcome is the higher volume of American-published publications and the growing interest following the introduction of Industry 4.0.
