One key source of social knowledge for netizens is network news. A deluge of news content makes it difficult for netizens to find important information. Under artificial lighting, named entity recognition technology can classify location, date, and other information from text data. Deep learning technology and named entity recognition are combined in this article. The suggested technique, in particular, presents a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that may attain high accuracy with a limited amount of training data sets and an automated annotation strategy for Chinese entity triggers. Using a trigger-matching network, the technique simultaneously trains sentence and trigger vectors, using the trigger vectors as attention queries for later sequence annotation models. Moreover, the suggested technique makes use of entity labels to identify neologisms in online news in an efficient manner. This allows for the modification of the set of sensitive words and the quantity of words in the set that need to be identified, in addition to expanding the lexicon of web news terms that convey sentiment for sentiment observation. According to experimental results, the suggested model performs better than the standard BiLSTM-CRF model, using just 20% of the proportional training data set, as opposed to the conventional model's 40% of the training data set. Furthermore, the loss function curve demonstrates that my model outperforms the comparative model in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. In conclusion, my model's average accuracy rate for sentiment perspective recognition is 97.88%.
