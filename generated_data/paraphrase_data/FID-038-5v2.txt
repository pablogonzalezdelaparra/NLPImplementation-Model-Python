With technology becoming a crucial part of every day life, artificial intelligence is now required for both production and service systems. Autonomously operating vehicles, sometimes referred to as driverless automobiles, function without the need for human intervention. Recent years have seen significant advancements in the field of autonomous vehicle research. The modern civilization requires autonomous automobiles with artificial intelligence. Despite the fact that some individuals might be reluctant to hand over control of their car to a computer, automated driving technologies have the potential to increase road safety. Both safety-related and environmental concerns may be handled by self-driving cars. Computers, in contrast to humans, do not truly struggle with maintaining focus when operating a vehicle. Furthermore, an autonomous vehicle can avert collisions in reaction to potentially hazardous roadside situations by reacting correctly. One benefit of self-driving technology is that it will make transportation for those who are unable to drive easier to obtain. Many people are incapable of operating a car due to a number of factors, including age, infirmity, or lack of expertise. These people are able to move far more freely and safely. Thus, in this chapter, we will examine the designs of autonomous automobile hardware and software, as well as their components, advantages, and potential future advances.
