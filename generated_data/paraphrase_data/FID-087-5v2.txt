Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being used in a growing number of Human Resources (HR) roles. The purpose of this study is to learn how various specialists from various organizations, including managers, supervisors, project managers, and human resource managers, view the potential of artificial intelligence-based recommender systems to match employee profiles with job profiles. This study notably uses a Delphi study-based technique, assembling an expert panel to offer their perspectives by scoring and commenting on a series of ideas. This research attempts to uncover the difficulties associated with matching employee and job profiles using artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies in the form of recommender systems, based on the findings of the online Delphi survey and participant perspectives. In this study, we have examined the many obstacles that arise when trying to match job profiles with employee profiles, as well as the contemporary issues that CEOs, HR staff, and supervisors—such as project managers—face in an organization. The study also highlights the possibility or viability of using artificial intelligence to create recommender systems, where we test a few hypotheses centered on potential fixes and different difficulties in matching job profiles inside an organization with employee profiles.
