To keep players interested in a game, the difficulty level should be just right. One popular method for dynamically changing game elements to maximize player experience is called Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA). This study examines the literature on methods for changing the difficulty of video games according on a player's performance, feelings, or personality. In order to do this, we looked into DDA research that used player modeling strategies, machine learning techniques, data kinds for evaluating players' states, testbed game genres, and applications. The review's data sources included publications from conferences and journals that were published until September 2022. According to the results, the majority of research has demonstrated that DDA significantly affects variables like enjoyment, flow, motivation, engagement, and immersion. Furthermore, player modeling and machine learning approaches have also drawn increased interest in DDA design. However, given the growing popularity of games across a range of industries, further study is required to better understand player preferences and effectively modify game characteristics. Better understanding of players' preferences will be achievable by more study on players' cognitive traits, such as visual attention, working memory, and response speed.
