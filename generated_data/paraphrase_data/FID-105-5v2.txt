Recent years have seen a notable advancement in the commercial use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially in fields like textual analysis, picture identification, natural voice processing, language translation, and self-learning. These fields had previously seen a lack of progress, making it seem as though intellect was a need for these abilities. These commercial advancements, however, have shown their optimum performance in single-task applications when occasional frank mistakes and unsatisfactory outputs are acceptable. Anesthesiology is not like other fields of medicine. Rather than being a single cognitive act, it incorporates a demand for high dependability as well as a demanding cycle of interpretation, physical action, and reaction. For the practicing anesthesiologist, this overview explains the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning and shows how basic equations may produce decision-making behaviors. The introduction of pertinent clinical issues demonstrates how machine learning may be used to address them, perhaps ushering in a new age of machine-assisted research in the field of anesthesiology.
