A lot of industries, including education, are fast changing due to artificial intelligence (AI). Artificial Intelligence is being applied to school administration to improve student results, optimize the learning process, and expedite administrative duties. This study is to investigate the advantages and difficulties of using AI in educational administration. Using a systematic review technique, the research project looks at the literature on artificial intelligence in educational management. According to the study, artificial intelligence (AI) provides a number of benefits, including increased student engagement, cost effectiveness, and customization of learning. AI, however, also presents a number of difficulties, including the requirement to retrain the workforce, possible biases, and ethical issues. The study comes to the conclusion that while AI has a great deal of potential to enhance school management, its use must be done so carefully.
