In medical imaging, tumor segmentation in breast ultrasound (US) pictures is a crucial problem. Even for experienced radiologists, segmenting and classifying anomalies can be challenging due to the low quality of US pictures and the different specifications of US equipment. The goal of the research is to present a unique AI-based hybrid model for US segmentation that can handle data that has never been seen before, gives excellent accuracy, and uses comparatively less datasets. The US-guided biopsies and diagnostics may both be performed using the program. We have presented a novel and resilient hybrid strategy that blends multi-agent artificial life (AL) and deep learning (DL). Three US datasets are used to validate the methods. The approach works better than 14 carefully chosen cutting-edge algorithms when applied to US photos with complicated geometry and a lot of noise. The article provides an innovative categorization of the pictures and assessments to examine the boundaries of the DL. Using 1264 ultrasound scans, the model has been trained and validated. Both JPEG and PNG formats are used for the photos. The patients are between the ages of 22 and 73. DL techniques, machine learning, edge linking, superpixels, and deformable forms are among the 14 benchmark algorithms. Eight-region shape- and contour-based assessment measures are used in the testing. In terms of the dice coefficient (region) and the relative Hausdorff distance H3 (contour-based), the suggested method (DL-AL) yields excellent results as follows: Dice = 0.96 and H3 = 0.26 for the easiest image complexity level; Dice = 0.91 and H3 = 0.82 for the medium complexity level; and Dice = 0.90 and H3 = 0.84 for the hardest complexity level. The pattern is the same for all other measures. The DL-AL performs 10â€“20% better than the second-best (Unet-based) approach. A number of non-traditional tests have also been performed on the approach. The model was applied to the complete set of photos after being trained on images with low complexity. This is a summary of the findings. (1) Dice = 0.80 and H3 = 2.01 are the only low complexity pictures that were utilized for training (68% unknown images). (2) Of the photos used for training (51% unknown images), the low and medium complexity images are Dice = 0.86 and H3 = 1.32. (3) Dice = 0.92 and H3 = 0.76 are the low, medium, and hard complexity pictures that were utilized for training (35% unknown images). These experiments demonstrate that DL-AL has a noteworthy 30% advantage.
