Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most important innovations that has permeated both our daily lives and industrial processes. Its quick development portends revolutionary effects in a number of areas, from cutting-edge businesses to regular people's lives. AI is continuously improving human experiences by modifying interactions and enhancing capacities. For example, modern educational institutions use facial recognition technology to track attendance using AI algorithms. In the future, autonomous vehicles—where cars completely rely on AI systems for navigation, traffic signal detection, and route navigation—represent the ultimate use of artificial intelligence.
