This study examined the possible research directions and obstacles around artificial intelligence (AI) in education by doing a content analysis of publications that sought to reveal how AI has been used in the field. A total of 100 publications were chosen from the Social Sciences Citation Index database's education and educational research category between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 63 empirical papers (74 studies) and 37 analytical papers were included. According to the content analysis, the research questions fall into three categories: integration layer (affection computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and gamification), application layer (feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning), and development layer (classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning). In addition, an evaluation of AI in education and four research themes—Internet of Things, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience—were recommended for more study. But we also suggested that the problems in education may be brought on by AI in terms of improper use of AI methods, shifting teacher and student roles, and ethical and societal concerns. The findings offer an overview of the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in education, which contributes to the theoretical underpinnings of AI in education and offers educators and AI developers a viable avenue for future cooperative study.
