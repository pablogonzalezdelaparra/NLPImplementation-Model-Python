This paper looks at a way to improve the dynamic performance of induction machines by addressing the main control issues. Some disadvantages of traditional direct torque control and indirect control with flux orientation include rising time, torque ripples, torque harmonics, and flux ripples. We suggest a comparison of earlier methods with the fuzzy logic technique in this paper. The simulation's results demonstrate that the fuzzy logic direct torque control approach avoids torque and flux variations at low switching frequencies and is more effective at responding quickly and precisely without overshooting. Increased operational reliability and efficiency are benefits of the dynamic performance enhancements that have been shown in industrial applications.
