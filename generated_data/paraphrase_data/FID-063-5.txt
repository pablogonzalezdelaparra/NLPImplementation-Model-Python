This study investigates the ethical dilemmas and regulatory mechanisms around Artificial Intelligence (AI) with regards to data integrity and its impact on social dynamics. A cross-sectional survey approach was used to collect primary data from 650 AI practitioners in different sectors, including developers, data scientists, ethicists, and policymakers. The study examined the associations between regulatory compliance, ethical awareness, professional training, and expertise in AI practice with the efficacy of AI installation and data integrity. The results showed a significant and positive relationship between increased levels of adherence to regulations and the perceived success of implementing artificial intelligence. Additionally, there was a favorable association between awareness of AI ethics and the assurance of data integrity. Furthermore, a notable correlation was found between receiving professional education in artificial intelligence and the favorable influence it has on social interactions. Nevertheless, although there is a favorable relationship between experience in the AI sector and data integrity, the connection is not very strong. This suggests that having experience alone is not enough to guarantee good AI practices. The study emphasizes the significance of ethical considerations, legal frameworks, and professional training in influencing the development of AI and its impact on society. There is a strong emphasis on the requirement for regulatory frameworks that are dynamic, adaptive, and inclusive. These frameworks should be able to connect AI practices with societal values and ethical norms. Potential areas for future research involve investigating AI ethics and governance within various cultural contexts, as well as examining the influence of new technologies such as quantum computing on AI ethics.
