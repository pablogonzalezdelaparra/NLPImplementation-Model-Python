This work introduces computer animation to the Self-Reproduction feature of Artificial Life. A gene-control based self-reproduction model of artificial fish is proposed and constructed. The contents of Artificial Fish's chromosome are provided based on its phenotypic. Heredity guidelines are provided on the basis of this model. In the virtual marine environment, artificial fish might procreate and develop under the free reign of the gene model and regulations. Predetermined and nondeterminate behaviors are examples of artificial behaviors. Artificial intelligence-based cognitive models are proposed and developed to regulate high-level behaviors of artificial fish. A simulation software is created and developed using all of the previously constructed models. These laid the foundation for raising the automation level and efficiency of artificial fish animation.
