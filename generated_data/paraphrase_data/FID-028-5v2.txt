Face recognition is crucial for many applications, including security, monitoring, and identity verification. The majority of homes have CC cameras installed so they can identify people from them for safety reasons. The purpose of these CCTVs is to keep people secure and track visitors to their homes. In a select few, highly guarded locations where it is totally forbidden to admit any unknown invader. Therefore, the topic of this research is a system that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify an intruder's face from a surveillance camera. Using HOG feature extraction and SVM classification methods, the design is effectively executed, classifying the faces in an input video stream. This paper's main goal is to use a HOG feature extractor to identify faces from a video, categorize those faces using support vector machines (SVMs), and train the system to distinguish between intruders and employees.
