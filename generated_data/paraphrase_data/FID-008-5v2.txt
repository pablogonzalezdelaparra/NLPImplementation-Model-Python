To stay abreast of the most recent technical advancements and adapt to the shifting demands of the engineering industry, engineering education is always changing. The application of generative artificial intelligence technologies, such the ChatGPT conversational agent, is one exciting advancement in this sector. Through the creation of realistic virtual simulations for hands-on learning and the provision of tailored feedback and explanations to students, ChatGPT has the potential to provide individualized and successful learning experiences. It's crucial to take into account this technology's limits, though. Because ChatGPT and other generative AI systems rely on their training data, they run the risk of creating and disseminating false information or perpetuating prejudices. Furthermore, there are ethical questions raised by the use of generative AI in education, including the possibility of students using it unethically or dishonestly and the possibility of job losses for those whose jobs are replaced by technology. Although ChatGPT represents an outstanding but imperfect state of generative AI technology today, it is but a taste of things to come. To ensure that the upcoming generation of engineers can maximize the positive effects of generative AI while minimizing its drawbacks, it is imperative that engineering educators comprehend the implications of this technology and research ways to modify the engineering education ecosystem.
