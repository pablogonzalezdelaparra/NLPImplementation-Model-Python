Artificial intelligence is a burgeoning technology that replicates human intelligence in machines by programming them to emulate human thinking and imitate their behaviors. An autonomous vehicle is capable of operating independently and performing essential tasks without any human intervention. This cutting-edge technology has the potential to enhance passenger safety, alleviate traffic congestion, optimize traffic flow, reduce fuel consumption, minimize pollution, and improve overall travel experiences. Autonomous vehicles are crucial in manufacturing, agricultural, transportation, and military domains. The actions of the autonomous vehicle are facilitated by sensor data and a limited number of artificial intelligence systems. Artificial intelligence encompasses the gathering of data, determining optimal routes, and carrying out tasks in self-driving vehicles, which necessitate the utilization of machine learning methods inherent to artificial intelligence. However, there are certain privacy and security problems associated with this. Autonomous vehicles place significant emphasis on security. This article will address the concerns around cybersecurity when integrating artificial intelligence into autonomous vehicles, as well as the advancements in self-driving car technology.
