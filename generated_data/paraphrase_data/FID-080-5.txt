Convenient internet access and rapid technological progress have led to an overwhelming amount of information and a wide range of choices, which has made decision-making highly challenging. A Recommender System (RS) is a promising system that aids users in decision-making by providing recommendations or predictions for product ratings. There are three primary types of RS that utilize either implicit or explicit feedback for recommendation: collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid filtering. Ratings are a prevalent type of feedback, but product descriptions, reviews, photographs, audios, and videos are equally significant and can enhance the effectiveness of the conventional RS. These supplementary variables can greatly influence the performance of RS. Previously, traditional recommendation systems (RSs) relied on methods such as nearest neighbor or other machine learning models. However, with recent advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning, RSs are now being created utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNNs are able to effectively utilize additional information. This article not only compares CNN-based recommendation systems (RSs) based on common criteria, but also thoroughly explores the utilization of different types of auxiliary information in CNN-based RSs. The study also examines the attributes of the data, statistical information about the data, and additional supporting details found in various datasets that are accessible to the public. The paper also examines several assessment metrics for recommendation systems and presents readers with intriguing problems and ongoing research topics.
