Purpose: The primary objective of the study was to examine the efficacy of recommender systems in the process of knowledge discovery. technique: The study utilized a desktop research technique. Desk research, often known as secondary data, refers to the collection of information that does not need fieldwork. Desk research mostly involves gathering data from pre-existing resources, making it a cost-effective strategy when compared to field research. The primary expenses associated with desk research include the time of the executive, telephone rates, and directories. Therefore, the study relied on previously published studies, reports, and statistics. The secondary data was readily available via internet journals and library resources. Analysis: The analysis indicates that there is a lack of context and methodology in the field of recommender systems in knowledge discovery. The research on the efficacy of recommender systems in knowledge discovery revealed that these systems played a crucial role in aiding users' exploration of extensive information repositories, allowing them to locate pertinent resources and enhance their knowledge. It was discovered that recommender systems utilizing sophisticated algorithms and personalized methodologies exhibited greater efficacy in producing pertinent recommendations customized to users' tastes and requirements. Moreover, the study emphasized the significance of promoting active user participation in the recommendation process by pointing out the positive relationship between user engagement measures and knowledge discovery outcomes. The identification of contextual information was also recognized as a pivotal component impacting the effectiveness of recommendations. In summary, the study emphasized the importance of constantly improving and optimizing recommender system algorithms in order to improve the outcomes of information discovery for consumers. The Social Learning theory, Information Foraging theory, and Cognitive Load theory can serve as foundational frameworks for future research on recommender systems in knowledge discovery, offering distinct and valuable insights. The study offered suggestions to improve the effectiveness of such systems. The proposal recommends the adoption of hybrid recommender systems, which integrate collaborative and content-based filtering techniques, in order to provide more precise and varied recommendations. Furthermore, the study highlighted the significance of including contextual data into recommendation algorithms in order to adapt recommendations according to situational circumstances. Moreover, it suggested the utilization of explainable AI methodologies to enhance transparency and user comprehension of recommendation procedures. Emphasizing the need of user engagement through active participation and feedback was also identified as vital. Additionally, promoting recommendation diversity is necessary to encourage exploration and the accidental discovery of new knowledge resources.
