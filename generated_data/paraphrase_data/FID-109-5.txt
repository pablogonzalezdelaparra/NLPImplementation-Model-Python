Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained significant attention due to groundbreaking technological advancements and remarkable experimental outcomes, particularly in the domain of picture analysis and processing. Within the field of medicine, several specializations such as radiology, pathology, and oncology have recognized the significance of utilizing images. As a result, substantial research and development efforts have been dedicated to harnessing the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) for therapeutic purposes. As AI becomes increasingly common in medical imaging analytic activities like diagnosis, segmentation, and classification, the safe and efficient use of clinical AI applications depends, in part, on well-informed practitioners. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the fundamental technological foundations of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the most advanced machine learning techniques and their utilization in the field of medical imaging. Furthermore, we delve into the emerging patterns and prospective avenues for future investigation. This text aims to elucidate the increasing prevalence of AI approaches in medical image analysis workflows and their potential to facilitate the adoption of AI-based solutions in clinical settings.
