The use of computer vision (CV) and artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to drastically alter the delivery of healthcare. Applications for AI-enhanced computer vision include illness identification, patient health monitoring, medical image analysis, surgical support, accelerating drug development, and developing customized treatment plans. Using AI-assisted computer vision in healthcare can lead to better patient outcomes, faster drug development, more accurate diagnosis, reduced costs, and individualized therapy. Nonetheless, the utilization of these technologies poses challenges with data privacy, prejudice, and legal issues. This chapter covers the types of computer vision used in healthcare systems, such as behavioral analysis, medicine discovery, movement and gait analysis, medical picture analysis, and illness diagnosis. The chapter also discusses the challenges of using computer vision in healthcare, such as the complexity of biological systems, prejudice, data privacy issues, accessibility issues, and legal issues. All things considered, AI-assisted computer vision has great potential to transform healthcare systems by improving patient outcomes, enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis, and reducing costs. It is imperative to address the challenges surrounding these technologies in order to ensure that they are used in an ethical and responsible manner.
