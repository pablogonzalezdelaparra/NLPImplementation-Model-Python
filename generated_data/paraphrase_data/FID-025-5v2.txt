Several artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies were employed during the COVID-19 pandemic to manage the virus's transmission, including facial recognition technology (FRT). This device is envisioned as an effective tool to follow sick persons and gather real-time surveillance data, as preparations are being made for potential pandemics in the future. FRT presents certain ethical and legal challenges, such as its use without ensuring consent from the individuals under surveillance, the protection of biometric data collected through surveillance, and the risk of using this information for purposes other than public health. When used properly, FRT can support governments' strategies to implement public health surveillance, which is defined in the literature as "the systematic collection, storage, usage, and dissemination of personal information to identify an outbreak and mitigate the spread of disease." Even while it is extensively used in nations like China and Russia for pandemic preparedness for other reasons, western jurisdictions are far less likely to embrace it.
