A new chapter in transportation history has begun with the introduction of autonomous cars, which are using cutting edge technologies to completely change the way people move about. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and learning algorithms is fundamental to this progress, enabling cars to reach previously unheard-of levels of autonomy. This study offers a thorough examination of the development of artificial intelligence in autonomous cars, charting its path from basic ideas to the most current developments. The article begins with an overview of the present state of affairs before diving into the basic role that AI plays in influencing autonomous cars' decision-making skills. It clarifies the processes in the AI-powered vehicle development life cycle and addresses prejudice and ethical issues in AI-driven software development for autonomous cars. The paper illustrates how the research environment in the automobile sector has changed over time by providing statistical insights into the types and applications of AI/learning algorithms. The study also emphasizes how parameters play a critical part in truck and automobile algorithm optimization, enabling vehicles to adjust, learn, and perform better over time. In summary, it describes various degrees of autonomy, clarifies the subtle use of artificial intelligence and learning algorithms, and automates important activities at every stage. The paper also addresses the differences in software package sizes among various degrees of autonomy.
