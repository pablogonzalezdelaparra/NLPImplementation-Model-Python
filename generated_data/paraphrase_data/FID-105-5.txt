Artificial intelligence and machine learning have made significant advancements in commercial applications, including in picture recognition, natural speech processing, language translation, textual analysis, and self-learning. Progress in these areas has previously been slow, causing these talents to be closely associated with intelligence. Nevertheless, these commercial advancements have excelled only in single-task applications where it is acceptable to have imprecise outputs and occasional blatant errors. Anesthesiology is distinct in its approach and methodology. The concept encompasses the need for utmost dependability and a demanding sequence of understanding, physical execution, and reaction, rather than a solitary mental process. This paper provides a concise explanation of artificial intelligence and machine learning for anesthesiologists, focusing on how decision-making processes might arise from basic mathematical equations. The introduction of relevant clinical questions serves to exemplify how machine learning might potentially aid in their resolution, potentially ushering anesthesiology into an era of machine-assisted discovery.
