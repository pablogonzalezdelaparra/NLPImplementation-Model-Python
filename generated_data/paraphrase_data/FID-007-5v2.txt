This paper presents five major points of contention that require further consideration in future discussions and decision-making on artificial intelligence in education, in light of the rapidly expanding public, governmental, and professional debates on the subject. Among these are: (1) being cautious to concentrate on concerns about "actually existing" AI rather than the overhype of speculative AI technologies; (2) emphasizing the limitations of AI in terms of modeling social contexts and simulating human intelligence, autonomy, and emotions; (3) highlighting the negative social effects of AI use; (4) recognizing that claims about AI are motivated by values; and (5) keeping a closer eye on the ecological and environmental sustainability of AI development and application. Therefore, the case is made for addressing the continued use of AI in education as a political activity that has varied effects on diverse groups of people in various educational contexts, in contrast to common views of AI as a neutral instrument.
