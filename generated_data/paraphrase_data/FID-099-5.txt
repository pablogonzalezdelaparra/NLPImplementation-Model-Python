The metaverse has arisen as a captivating new framework for the interaction between humans and computers, as well as for virtual collaboration. This study provides a thorough examination of the metaverse to fill the void in current research, where there is a scarcity of a survey that evaluates the characteristics of the metaverse and its fundamental components from a human-centered viewpoint. Initially, we compile a precise description of the metaverse by analyzing relevant literature and identifying its essential characteristics. Next, we present a comprehensive framework that covers the characteristics of metaverses, the technologies used for infrastructure, and the technologies used for input/output. This framework enables the creation of multi-sensory human-computer interaction and may be applied in various disciplines. This framework provides comprehensive explanations of its components, delivering valuable insights into the inherent characteristics of metaverses and the current technological preparedness level. Using this extensive research, we identify significant unresolved issues and suggest potential avenues that require additional exploration and investigation. This review offers crucial insights and acts as a vital resource for metaverse developers and academics aiming to progress this revolutionary new medium. It clarifies the goal for the metaverse and outlines the necessary building pieces to bring it to life.
