In order to categorize English text emotion expression and information communication in accordance with the human emotion-value relationship, this paper first investigates these topics. It then lists the hallmarks of English emotion expression and information communication. Second, it is suggested to build an analysis model for English text emotion and information transmission using the BiLSTM neural network, utilizing artificial intelligence technology. The BiLSTM neural network is used to extract the emotional features of English text and solve the problem of the loss of emotional features through the loss function in order to deal with the characteristics of English text quickly and effectively. This process of encoding the emotional information of English text is necessary in order to deal with its characteristics. The dataset from the Chinese English module of the MOOC of Chinese universities is then obtained using the crawler tool, and the evaluation indexes are set based on the model's performance. This is followed by an experimental analysis of the English text's ability to convey information and express emotion. The findings demonstrate that the BiLSTM-based neural network outperforms the original CNN, LSTM, and T-LSTM in the task of text emotion expression and information conveyance, with the accuracy rate remaining above 0.925. Additionally, the effect on the English dataset is marginally better than that on the Chinese dataset. The purpose of this study is to improve communication between Chinese and other cultures as well as English instruction.
