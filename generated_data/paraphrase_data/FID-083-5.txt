Smart cities are the result of combining information and communication technology (ICT) with urban management in order to enhance the quality of life for people living in cities. Recommender systems, which provide personalized advice to urban residents, have become important contributors to this confluence. Their effective implementation in diverse aspects of urban life and their capacity to handle vast quantities of data produced in city environments has accelerated their importance as a vital technology in the advancement of urban planning. Our research involved doing a thorough examination of the Web of Science database, which yielded a total of 130 articles. After applying a relevancy filter, the number of articles was decreased to 86. The initial phase involved doing a bibliometric analysis using the SciMAT program to examine structural factors. Furthermore, a methodical examination of existing literature was conducted utilizing the PRISMA 2020 declaration. The results demonstrated the various mechanisms by which recommendations are screened in domains such as tourism, health, mobility, and transit. This research is considered an important discovery that has the potential to enhance the development and effectiveness of smart cities, laying a strong foundation for future research in this rapidly changing sector.
