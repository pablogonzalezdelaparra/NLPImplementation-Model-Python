The accuracy and effectiveness of deep learning algorithms are becoming more and more important to a growing range of businesses as artificial intelligence develops quickly. However, because deep neural networks are opaque and have a black box effect, we are only able to receive outcomes without understanding the underlying applied logic. This causes some deep learning-based technology supporters to be skeptical and resistant. It can be challenging for decision-makers to accept the results of emotion analysis in the context of business and public opinion monitoring when the computers are meant to be dispassionate. There are explanation techniques based on mathematics, and they frequently generalize emotion analysis to the goal of categorization. Emotion, however, need to be treated differently from other work categories due to the human-specific elements and reasoning involved in its creation. Based on psychological theories, this research suggests an explanatory framework for emotion analysis that emphasizes the stimulus from traditional emotion theories. The two primary components of this suggested framework, which emphasizes on the source and trigger of emotions as an explanation for deep learning-based emotion analysis, are the extraction of the emotion cause and the visualisation of words that elicit emotions.
