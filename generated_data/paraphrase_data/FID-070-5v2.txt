When it comes to power flow optimization, fuzzy logic proves to be an effective technique, especially when dealing with deregulated power networks. Fuzzy logic controllers may be used to arrange distribution generators (DGs) in the best possible way, as long as optimal power flow solutions and fuzzy logic controllers are used to identify the dependability indices and preserve system feasibility. Distribution generator units should be positioned strategically in a deregulated power system to reduce power loss and improve overall system performance by reducing volatility. In a deregulated electricity system, access to optimal power flow algorithms becomes crucial to pinpoint weak points, particularly within transmission firms. The distribution and transmission networks should both be suitably modified to reduce congestion inside the corresponding businesses. Using information gathered from distribution and transmission businesses in the deregulated electricity system, the aggregator must evaluate the system's performance.
