With the ongoing advancements in science and technology, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other fields, the educational system has started to implement more customized material in addition to more conventional functions in recent years. Conventional educational institutions frequently use a one-size-fits-all method of instruction that ignores the individual demands and learning preferences of every student. In order to improve learning outcomes, a personalized and optimized education system using machine learning algorithms can offer tailored learning materials and recommendations based on each student's learning background, interests, and skills. Additionally, these algorithms can provide real-time feedback on student performance and modify learning plans in response to that feedback. As a result, learning becomes more tailored and dynamic. As a result, it may be used in all subject areas of study, including science, math, and language instruction. Nonetheless, enhancing the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms is mostly dependent on advancing numerical optimization algorithms; hence, a summary of optimization algorithms is imperative in large-scale machine learning. In addition to introducing the algorithm optimization method, this study attempts to provide a thorough review of the machine learning algorithms currently in use for optimizing customized education recommendation systems.
