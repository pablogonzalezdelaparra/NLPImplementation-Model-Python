Adaptation and innovation are crucial to the manufacturing industry. This advancement is expected to result in the implementation of environmentally-friendly production methods through the utilization of innovative technologies. In order to advance sustainability, the implementation of smart industrial technologies necessitates a worldwide outlook. Thanks to extensive research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), several AI-based approaches, including machine learning, have been successfully used in the industry to promote sustainable production. The objective of this research was to thoroughly assess the scientific literature on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) in the industry. Indeed, the advent of Industry 4.0 has positioned artificial intelligence and machine learning as the primary catalysts behind the transformative smart factory revolution. The objective of this review was to categorize the literature based on many factors such as publication year, authors, scientific sector, nation, institution, and keywords. The analysis was conducted utilizing the Web of Science and SCOPUS database. In addition, the researchers utilized UCINET and NVivo 12 software to carry out the tasks. A systematic analysis of empirical studies on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) published in the past century was conducted to examine the progression of the subject before and after the advent of Industry 4.0, spanning from 1999 to the present. A total of eighty-two papers were examined and categorized. One notable finding is the higher quantity of publications produced by the United States, which has seen a surge in interest following the emergence of Industry 4.0.
