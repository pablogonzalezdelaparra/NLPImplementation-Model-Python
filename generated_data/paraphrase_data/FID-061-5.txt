Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful and influential factor in multiple industries, such as medicine and healthcare. Language models such as ChatGPT demonstrate the capabilities of AI by producing text that closely resembles human language when given cues. ChatGPT's versatility shows potential for transforming medical practices, enhancing patient care, and improving interactions between healthcare professionals, patients, and data. ChatGPT efficiently spreads crucial information in the field of pandemic management. It functions as a digital assistant during surgical consultations, assists dental offices, streamlines medical education, and aids in illness diagnostics. 82 papers were classified into eight main categories: G1: treatment and medicine, G2: buildings and equipment, G3: parts of the human body and disease areas, G4: patients, G5: citizens, G6: cellular imaging, radiology, pulse, and medical images, G7: doctors and nurses, and G8: tools, devices, and administration. Striking a balance between the function of AI and human judgment continues to be a difficulty. A systematic literature review conducted using the PRISMA approach examined the transformational capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. The review specifically focused on the various uses, limitations, motivation, and problems of ChatGPT in this field. Ultimately, the varied medical uses of ChatGPT highlight its capacity for groundbreaking advancements, making it an invaluable tool for students, scholars, and healthcare researchers. Moreover, this study functions as a comprehensive manual, providing support and guidance to students, scholars, and researchers in the domain of medicine and healthcare.
