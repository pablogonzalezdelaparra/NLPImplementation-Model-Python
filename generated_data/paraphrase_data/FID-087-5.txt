Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being extensively utilized in many Human Resources (HR) operations. The objective of this research is to get insight into the perspectives of various professionals from different organizations, including Project Managers, Managers, Supervisors, and Human Resource Managers, about the potential of artificial intelligence-based recommender systems in aligning job profiles with employee profiles. This study utilizes a Delphi study approach, which involves assembling a panel of experts who express their thoughts by scoring and commenting on a series of propositions. This research seeks to uncover the obstacles associated with matching employees to job profiles using artificial intelligence and machine learning tools, namely recommender systems. The study is based on the results of an online Delphi study and participant perspectives. This study examines the challenges associated with aligning staff profiles with job profiles, as well as the specific issues encountered by executives, human resource personnel, and supervisors, such as project managers, inside an organization. The study also provides insights into the possibility and viability of using artificial intelligence in the form of recommender systems. We also examine several propositions that address potential solutions and obstacles in matching employee profiles to job profiles inside an organization.
