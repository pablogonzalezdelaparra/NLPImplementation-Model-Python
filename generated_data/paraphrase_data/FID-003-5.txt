Approach: This review study employed a narrative synthesis and a systematic literature review. The literature and information were sourced from a range of publications and research articles accessed through academic databases such as EBSCO, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect. The inclusion criteria encompassed research that provided a clear definition of artificial intelligence in the education sector, were published and written in English, and underwent peer review. Five autonomous reviewers evaluated the search results, retrieved data, and determined the quality of the research in order to summarize and publish the findings. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence has already made its way into the education industry. Integrating artificial intelligence is a crucial and essential element in the advancement of education. Moreover, artificial intelligence is progressively employed as a digital assistant. They provide support to teachers and students in multiple ways, such as granting pupils access to a diverse array of educational resources tailored to their individual learning requirements and academic disciplines. Nevertheless, artificial intelligence breakthroughs carry certain hazards, including those related to safety, security, and privacy. Artificial intelligence technologies have both beneficial and bad impacts on the education sector. Therefore, it is imperative to give top priority to integrating artificial intelligence into education and devising suitable strategies to fulfill the demands and expectations of teachers and students through the use of AI technology. Consequently, academic performance will be outstanding. Recommendation & Implication: In the future, qualitative research methods like interviews or quantitative analytic methods like online questionnaires could be utilized to offer more comprehensive explanations and clear-cut conclusions. The consequences of this research can be utilized by school administrators, teachers, and students to have a deeper understanding and effectively apply suitable ways for enhancing educational performance using artificial intelligence.
