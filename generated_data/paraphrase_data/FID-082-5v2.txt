An extensive survey of the literature on the development and use of machine learning (ML) algorithms in recommender systems (RS) is provided in this study. Published in 2023 (Januaryâ€“June), the study attempts to pinpoint current trends, investigate practical applications, and direct scholars in directing their research endeavors in this area. The results are divided into several categories, such as digital journalism, e-commerce, education, healthcare, and machine learning algorithms (auto-encoders and reinforcement learning). In light of the application in manufacturing enterprises, the review highlights the improved recommendation accuracy, increased scalability, personalization and context awareness, various ML techniques, and strategies for handling cold start and data sparsity. It also lays the groundwork for future advancements in ML algorithms for RSs.
