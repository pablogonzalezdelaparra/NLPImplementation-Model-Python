Over the past few years, the academic and scientific community has turned its attention to video games, with a particular emphasis on the development and testing of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). AGI experimental platforms enable the visual analysis and study of the behavior of various AI agents that have previously been specified. This study presents GAGI, a revolutionary gaming engine that may be used as an experimental platform for artificial intelligence. GAGI is a game engine that uses the C++ programming language to develop and produce innovative 2D and 3D video games. Furthermore, within the generated game, GAGI offers the user a unique setting for researching and modeling AI agents. It is possible for users to interact with many AI agents in real time when they are deployed, which enhances comprehension of their behaviors and interactions. The benefits of the suggested software's design capabilities and AI support are highlighted by contrasting its characteristics with those of other popular game engines utilized by the academic community and the video game industry. Additionally, GAGI provides the ability to replicate the studies, providing the scientific community with a multitude of options.
