This paper utilizes a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to examine voltage stability in a photovoltaic (PV)-based direct current (DC) microgrid. The microgrid consists of many photovoltaic (PV) modules, a DC-DC converter, and various loads. Ensuring voltage stability in DC microgrids is a challenging task due to the extensive utilization of intermittent PV power. This paper presents a voltage control technique based on Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC). The technique utilizes input elements such as photovoltaic (PV) output power, duty cycle of the DC-DC converter, and load current to determine the most suitable action for maintaining the stability of the system's voltage. The performance of the FLC is evaluated by simulation, with the objective of ensuring its resilience to parameter changes and uncertainties. The simulation findings indicate that the proposed FLC-based control technique effectively preserves the voltage stability of the microgrid in several operational scenarios, such as fluctuations in solar irradiance and load variations. Furthermore, the FLC exhibits superior performance compared to alternative control approaches.
