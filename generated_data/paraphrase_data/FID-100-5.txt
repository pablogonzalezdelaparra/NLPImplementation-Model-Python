In recent years, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) technologies has brought about considerable changes in the lifestyle of modern society. Artificial intelligence is a complex technology that encompasses multiple dimensions and includes advanced algorithms, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). In the near future, AI, ML, and DL are anticipated to offer automated gadgets to ophthalmologists, enabling them to diagnose ocular problems early and administer prompt therapy. Indeed, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have been employed in the field of ophthalmology to authenticate disease diagnoses, interpret images, conduct corneal topographic mapping, and calculate intraocular lens measurements. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma are the three predominant factors leading to permanent loss of vision worldwide. Ophthalmic imaging offers a means to diagnose and objectively monitor the advancement of several pathologies, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and other ophthalmic problems. In ophthalmic practice, there are two diagnostic imaging technologies commonly used: fundus digital photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). It is worth mentioning that OCT has emerged as the predominant imaging technique in ophthalmology practices in developed countries. The increasing need for such images is driven by changes in population demographics and lifestyle, the lengthening of average lifespan, and the shifting prevalence of chronic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, DR, AMD, and glaucoma. Moreover, the scarcity of retina specialists and adequately educated human graders is a significant challenge in numerous nations. Therefore, due to the ongoing trends in population increase, it is unavoidable that the analysis of such photos will require a significant amount of time, financial resources, and is susceptible to mistakes made by humans. Hence, the identification and management of diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and other eye illnesses using unmanned automated systems would be unavoidable in the coming years. We present a comprehensive analysis of how the current approaches of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) can potentially affect the early identification and management of diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and other eye-related conditions.
