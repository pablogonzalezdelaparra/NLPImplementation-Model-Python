The process of quantifying the usability expectation for an m-commerce mobile application using fuzzy logic principles involves testing the usability of the application. The usability of a mobile application is determined by assessing the user's expectations and preferences to assess their experience with the program. Fuzzy logic is consistently the most advantageous option for quantification. The usability expectation of an m-commerce mobile application is assessed using a fuzzy logic-based quantification method. This assessment considers the user's needs, preferences, and expectations to evaluate their overall user experience. Usability expectation encompasses the user's capacity to comprehend and engage with the application, the extent to which the application fulfills the user's expectations, and the overall level of happiness with the application. This technique facilitates the identification of areas that require improvement, allowing developers to implement essential modifications to enhance the user experience. This study introduces a framework for measuring usability and applies fuzzy logic to quantify the overall usability quality of an m-commerce mobile application. The proposed framework for measuring usability is founded on the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) methodology. Its purpose is to offer a thorough and methodical method for designing metrics that evaluate the qualitative element of mobile phone applications. The framework has been created and evaluated in the context of mobile commerce (m-commerce) and offers a collection of quantifiable criteria to measure the quality of mobile applications for m-commerce according to a standard. The evaluation results can be utilized to enhance m-commerce mobile applications and guarantee the optimization of the user experience.
