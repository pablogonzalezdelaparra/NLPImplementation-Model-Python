When combined with Deep Learning (DL), Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is an effective empirical search technique for agent decision-making, particularly when it comes to beating previously unbeatable board games. However, as real-time video games are often made for human players and thus need a large amount of resources for simulation, it does not seem to be as effective in this area, where the simulation time limit for exploration is a critical consideration. In this research, we offer a surrogate-assisted MCTS strategy that uses a deep-learning-based surrogate model to approximate gaming results, particularly aimed at commercial real-time video games. Our work's primary contribution is the modified MCTS we created for real-time, commercial video game processing. Our work might be seen as having pushed the realm unexplored by previous research, as commercial video games, in comparison to their non-commercial analogs, include far more complicated and dynamic gameplays to satisfy their market customers. By comparing our approach to other algorithms, such as the conventional MCTS, in the context of a for-profit real-time video game, we were able to verify its effectiveness.
