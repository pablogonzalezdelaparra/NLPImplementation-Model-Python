The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in smart homes, industrial control, and other domains is now meeting with positive reception. However, network security, data analysis, human-computer interaction, and other areas are problematic for AI technology, and it also has specific needs for computer performance. Although the visual platform of embedded systems has now produced impressive achievements in real-world applications, issues like inconsistent system performance and low overall development efficiency have severely impeded its progress. Based on AI technology, an EP Vision System (VS) was created in this work. The platform realized the intelligent robot interaction and target identification features by combining the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with integrated hardware architecture. According to the test findings, professionals and students had different opinions about System X: 16.5% and 10% thought it was unfavorable, and 83.5% and 90% thought it was positive under the same circumstances. However, just 19% and 4% of them gave System Y a favorable review, whilst 81% and 96% gave it a bad evaluation. Indicating that System X may somewhat increase the system recognition efficiency and satisfy the real application requirements, the percentage of favorable evaluations for System X was much greater than that of System Y. It demonstrated the beneficial connection between EP VS and AI technologies.
