A fascinating new paradigm for virtual collaboration and human-computer interaction (HCI) is the metaverse. In order to close the gap in the current literature, this study provides a thorough analysis of the metaverse, reviewing its components and nature from a human-centric standpoint. First, we outline the main affordances of the metaverse and compile a definition from the body of current research. We then provide a comprehensive framework that includes applications in many fields, the nature of the metaverse, input/output technologies, and infrastructure technologies that support multi-sensory HCI. This framework's components are thoroughly discussed, providing insights into the nature of the metaverse and the state of preparation of existing technologies. Based on this thorough analysis, we identify the main unresolved issues and suggest viable paths that need more research and development. This study offers crucial insights and is a priceless tool for metaverse developers and academics striving to progress this revolutionary new medium by outlining the metaverse's goal and defining the components needed to make it a reality.
