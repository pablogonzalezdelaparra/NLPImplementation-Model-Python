This paper suggests a cross-domain information fusion matrix decomposition algorithm to improve the accuracy of personalized recommendations in artificial intelligence recommendation systems, considering the difficulties of inter-domain information fusion and data sparsity in collaborative filtering algorithms. The study commences by gathering Douban movie rating data and social network information. In order to maintain the accuracy of the data, the procedure of Levenshtein distance detection is used to eliminate duplicate scores. Additionally, natural language processing technology is applied to extract keywords and topic information from social texts. In addition, graph convolutional networks are employed to transform user associations into feature vectors, while a distinctive thermal coding technique is employed to turn discrete user and movie information into binary matrices. In order to mitigate overfitting, the Ridge regularization technique is employed to systematically optimize the potential feature vectors. Subsequently, the weighted average and feature connection approaches are employed to amalgamate characteristics derived from various domains. In addition, the article integrates the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm with merging user characteristics in order to produce tailored recommendation lists. The research performs cross-domain information fusion optimization on four widely-used mathematical matrix decomposition strategies throughout the experimental phase. These algorithms include the alternating least squares method, non-negative matrix decomposition, singular value decomposition, and latent factor model (LFM). It contrasts these algorithms with the non-fused technique. The findings demonstrate a notable enhancement in the precision of scores, as seen by a decrease of 12.8% and 13.2% in the mean absolute error and root mean squared error, respectively, across all four algorithms. Moreover, with k=10, the mean F1 score attains 0.97, and the LFM algorithm's ranking accuracy coverage experiences a 54.2% rise. In summary, the integration of the mathematical matrix decomposition technique with cross-domain information fusion offers significant benefits in terms of accuracy, prediction performance, suggestion diversity, and ranking quality. Furthermore, it enhances the precision and variety of the recommendation system. By successfully tackling the obstacles of collaborative filtering through the incorporation of several methodologies, it greatly exceeds conventional models in terms of suggestion precision and diversity.
