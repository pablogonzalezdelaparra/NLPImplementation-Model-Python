Methods: This review article's narrative synthesis and systematic literature review were carried out. The literature and data came from a variety of sources, including EBSCO, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect books and research papers. Studies that provided a clear definition of artificial intelligence in the field of education, were published, written in English, and underwent peer review were the requirements for inclusion. In order to summarize and publish the findings, five impartial reviewers evaluated search results, gathered data, and set the research' quality. The outcome was that artificial intelligence has already permeated the field of education. An important and strategic component of educational progress is the use of artificial intelligence. Additionally, the usage of artificial intelligence as a digital assistant is growing. They support educators and learners in many ways, one of which is by providing students with an extensive library of educational resources tailored to their individual disciplines and learning requirements. Yet, there are some hazards connected to the development of artificial intelligence, including worries about privacy, security, and safety. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence technologies have both good and bad effects on education. As a result, they have an impact on the education sector in both positive and harmful ways. Artificial intelligence must thus be given top priority in education, and suitable methods must be put in place to satisfy the demands and expectations of both instructors and students through the use of AI technology. Academic performance will therefore be outstanding. Recommendation & Implication: To offer additional clarifications and precise conclusions, qualitative research—such as interviews—or quantitative analysis—such as online questionnaires—may be created in the future. The implications might help educators, administrators, and students better comprehend and put into practice effective techniques to use AI to improve student performance in the classroom.
