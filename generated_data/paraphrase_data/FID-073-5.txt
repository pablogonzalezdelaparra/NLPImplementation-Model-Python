The performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems is directly influenced by changes in climate. The controller ensures that the maximum potential energy is converted to operate the pumping system under normal conditions. Fuzzy logic intelligent controllers have proven to be effective and applicable in engineering and applied science. This paper aims to demonstrate an experimental method for implementing fuzzy logic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) with a boost converter based on the Arduino Mega micro-controller. The objective is to maximize energy production in various weather conditions for a small-scale pumping system used in water and chemical fluid analysis in isolated areas. The system is equipped with a set of 20 solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, each with a power output of 20 watts (W). This work introduces a real-time approach for regulating and monitoring Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) using MATLAB/Simulink and fuzzy logic. The method utilizes a low-cost Arduino Mega micro-controller and (LV25, LP55) sensors to operate a boost converter coupled to a solar panel and plastic pump.
