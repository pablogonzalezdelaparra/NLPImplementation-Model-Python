For many different countries, agriculture is the most important and principal source of domestic revenue. The sickness that many pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, cause in plants may cost agribusiness corporations a significant amount of money every year. Plant disease monitoring depends heavily on the security of crops in terms of both quantity and quality. Identifying plant diseases is so crucial. There are certain plant portions where the plant disease condition is apparent. However, the infection is typically seen on different plant leaves. Many researchers use techniques such as computer vision, deep learning, few-shot learning, and soft computing to automatically diagnose plant diseases from leaf photos. These methods also help farmers take prompt and appropriate action to prevent a decline in crop quality and quantity. By carefully choosing and extracting information from the disease, these strategies may be applied to recognize diseases and mitigate their origin-related disadvantages while also accelerating technological advancement and research efficiency. Additionally, specific molecular methods have been developed to lessen and minimize the damage posed by pathogens. As a result, this study offers specific diagnosis strategies to assist avoid illness and aids in the automatic detection of plant disease utilizing machine learning, deep learning, and few shot learning. Additionally, a few upcoming projects pertaining to illness categorization are also included.
