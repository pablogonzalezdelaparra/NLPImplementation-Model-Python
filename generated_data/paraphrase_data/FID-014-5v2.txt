For material analysis, inverse gas chromatography (IGC) has shown to be an extremely sensitive, flexible, and useful technique. IGC offers critical insight into material physicochemical data, including dispersive surface free energy, Gibbs surface energy components, and Guttamann Lewis acid-base parameters, by utilizing thermochemical techniques. We explore the instrumentation, history, and many applications of IGC in this extensive overview. The selection and description of many models used in IGC studies are described in detail, providing researchers and practitioners with useful information. IGC is used in many different fields, such as nanomaterials, minerals, polymers, medications, and surfactants. Moreover, IGC makes it easier to assess critical characteristics such surface heterogeneity, miscibility, solubility parameters, specific surface area, co/adhesion work, sorption enthalpy and entropy, and surface energy components (dispersive and specific). These discoveries expand our knowledge of material behavior and help in the development and improvement of cutting-edge materials. Furthermore, our comprehension of the complex surface texture, roughness, and associated attributes of materials has improved with the integration of IGC with computer vision and image processing techniques. The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision with IGC opens up new and intriguing possibilities for chemical material development in the future. This study presents the synergistic potential of merging IGC with AI and computer vision, in addition to offering a thorough introduction of IGC, its methods, and applications. Researchers, scientists, and other experts working in the field of advanced materials will find value in the insightful information and insights offered here, which will empower them to use IGC and AI to discover and create novel materials.
