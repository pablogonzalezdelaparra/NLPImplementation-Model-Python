Introduction: Artificial intelligence and neuroscience have been combining forces in recent years, especially in the area of brain research and the creation of therapies for neurological conditions. Deep learning and artificial neural networks offer important new perspectives on how the brain processes information. Current studies attempt to elucidate how brain functions affect an individual's level of pleasure. OBJECTIVES: To assess, in light of AI advancements, the relationship between happiness and neurobiology. METHODS: Articles from the Scopus database from 2013 to 2023 were utilized for a bibliometric study, and information was processed using VOSviewer. RESULTS A total of 603 papers were acquired, and it is clear that the United States (184), the United Kingdom (74), and China (73), are the centers of the most significant scientific creation. The Co-occurrence - Author Keywords analysis yields three groups. The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast pleasure are associated with the first cluster, red; AI tools in neuroscience are associated with the second cluster, green; and AI tools in psychology are connected with the third cluster, blue. Conclusion: Our knowledge of mental processes like emotions and awareness has advanced significantly as a result of neuroscience study. Happiness has been studied in neuroscience, and the field is becoming more open to an approach that looks for data to help artificial intelligence's understanding of people's well-being.
