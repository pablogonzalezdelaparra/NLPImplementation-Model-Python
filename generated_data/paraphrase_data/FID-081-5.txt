Recently, due to the rapid advancements in science and technology, particularly in artificial intelligence and machine algorithms, the education system has started incorporating more tailored content in addition to its traditional roles. Conventional education systems frequently employ a standardized teaching method that fails to consider the distinct requirements and learning preferences of individual students. A machine learning-based education system can offer tailored learning materials and suggestions by analyzing individual students' learning history, interests, and abilities. This personalized approach aims to enhance learning outcomes. Additionally, machine learning algorithms can provide immediate feedback on student performance and adapt learning plans accordingly. This enhances the learning process by making it more dynamic and tailored to individual needs. Consequently, it can be utilized in all educational domains, encompassing language acquisition, mathematics, science, and so on. Enhancing the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms mostly relies on the enhancement of numerical optimization algorithms. Therefore, it is imperative to consolidate the optimization algorithms used in large-scale machine learning. This work aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current machine learning algorithms used in optimizing personalized education recommendation systems. It also presents the process of optimizing these algorithms.
