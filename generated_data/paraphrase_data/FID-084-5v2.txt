Applications for remote healthcare based on the Internet of Things (IoT) offer patients who are at risk quick access to preventive care. But forecasting cardiac disease is a difficult undertaking, and diagnostic accuracy is seldom achieved. A unique Recommendation System for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using IoT Network (DEEP-CARDIO) has been presented to provide dietary advice, treatment suggestions, and pre-diagnosis for cardiac disorders in order to solve this problem. In the beginning, four biosensors—the ECG, pressure, pulse, and glucose sensors—are used to remotely gather the patient's physiological data. The IoT sensors' gathered data is sent to an Arduino controller, which uses it to forecast and identify the illness. BiGRU (Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit) attention model is used to create a cardiovascular disease prediction model that diagnoses cardiovascular illness and categorizes it into five different cardiovascular classes. Through a user-friendly smartphone application, the recommendation system offers nutritional and activity advice to cardiac patients based on the identified data. Using real-time Framingham and Statlog heart disease datasets, Cloud Simulator (CloudSim) validates the DEEP-CARDIO's performance. The total accuracy achieved by the suggested DEEP CARDIO approach is 99.90%, whereas the MABC-SVM, HCBDA, and MLbPM methods are 86.91%, 88.65%, and 93.63%, respectively.
