fitted into contemporary clever automobiles. Numerous foundation models based on artificial intelligence have been put forth for smart sensing, which recognizes recognized item classes in novel but comparable settings. Nevertheless, detecting all the item classes in both seen and unseen contexts remains a challenge for the foundation models of smart sensing. The goal of this letter is to advance the field of smart sensing for intelligent cars. First, we provide an overview of the foundation models that are now in widespread use and the foundation intelligence required for intelligent vehicle smart sensing. Next, in order to advance the foundation models of smart sensing from basic intelligence (1.0) to enhanced intelligence (2.0) and ultimately generalized intelligence (3.0), we describe Sora-based Parallel Vision. A number of illustrative case examples are presented to illustrate the possible applications of Sora-based Parallel Vision, and then the direction of future research is addressed.
