The remarkable powers of living beings stem from the manner in which their bodies manifest autonomy. Living organisms integrate computational or cognitive intelligence with physical intelligence by means of body morphology, material multifunctionality, and mechanical compliance, at various levels of organization. Although soft robotics has made progress in developing and creating physically intelligent bodies, including information-processing abilities for computational intelligence is still difficult. Hence, the construction of soft robots is now restricted by limits in perception and control. Achieving complete independence in autonomy would necessitate a purposeful alignment in the joint development of novel materials, manufacturing techniques, and control strategies for soft robots. Here, a novel viewpoint is proposed: researchers should only employ tasks to impose limitations on the design of soft robots, namely in terms of materials and information. A proposed conceptual framework introduces a task-first design paradigm that bypasses limits imposed by control mechanisms. This framework enables the efficient utilization of the combined material and information processing abilities of soft matter for the creation of agents capable of performing specific tasks. Special emphasis is given to the scale dependency of solutions. Lastly, this article discusses potential research prospects for attaining autonomy in upcoming soft robots, ranging in size from elephant trunks to paramecia.
