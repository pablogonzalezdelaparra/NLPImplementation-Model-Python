This article presents a study that uses computer vision algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify human emotions in video recordings as users interact with various visual stimuli. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and image processing pipelines may be used to detect emotions in software. The procedure entails evaluating individuals via photos and enabling computer vision algorithms that are in line with psychological theories that describe emotions and their distinguishable characteristics. The study shows that software creation and training based on facial expressions, together with the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for emotion identification, are feasible. The outcomes show that emotion recognition is successful; however, more training for settings with a wider range of picture types and additional algorithms to discern closely related emotional patterns are required for accuracy improvement. The promise of AI is emphasized in the debate and conclusions. Using computer vision algorithms in the identification of emotions, offering perceptions into the creation of software, continuous training, and the changing field of emotion recognition technology. In order to improve confidence and accuracy, new algorithms that can discriminate between facial expressions that portray closely comparable emotional patterns will need to be developed and trained for situations with a wider variety of pictures.
