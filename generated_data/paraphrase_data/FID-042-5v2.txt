The goal of this study was to find out how empathic human chatbot conversations were among Swedish computer science students at Uppsala University. The study investigated users' perceptions of anthropomorphic chatbots as either humans or machines, whether verbal abuse occurs during human-bot interactions, and how much participants expect chatbot assistance based on gender dynamics. Five students participated in semi-structured interviews as part of the qualitative data gathering process. Thematic analysis was used to manually examine the gathered data. The study's findings indicate that human-chatbot interactions can elicit empathy from participants, irrespective of their perception of anthropomorphic chatbots as either machines or people. However, participants become frustrated when they don't obtain the desired response from chatbots and leave the platform without voicing their displeasure. Usually, they forget about their irritation and return later with new queries, thus the amount of empathy is normally minimal. The study also demonstrates that if chatbots are more likely to be female, users may anticipate receiving more assistance and civility.
