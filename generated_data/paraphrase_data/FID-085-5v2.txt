The most recent attempt to provide managers and customers computing resources as a service signifies a move away from computing as a product that is bought and toward computing as a service that is provided to users via the internet from sizable data centers. But as cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) proliferate and advance customer experience automations in numerous application domains, including recommender systems (RS), it has become necessary to make a number of adjustments to support the IoT devices at the heart of the automation universe, including cutting-edge language models like ChatGPT and Bard and technological advancements like nanotechnology. This study presents IoT-driven fog computing (FC), a current computing advancement to the marketing community. While several studies on FC "smart" applications have been published, none have been done on fog-based smart marketing areas such recommender systems up to this point. FC is regarded as a cutting-edge computing system that may reduce latency and enhance bandwidth use for applications involving autonomous consumer behavior that need to make data-driven decisions in real time. In order to encourage further research, this paper offers a conceptual framework for examining the impact of fog computing on consumer behavior, using the junction of FC and RS as an example. In fact, the way we conceptualize "fog-based recommender systems" opens up a wide range of interesting and difficult research directions, some of which are discussed later in this paper. Keywords: artificial intelligence (AI), edge computing, fog computing, recommender system, internet of things (IoT), software defined networks (SDNs), information, as well as situational and personal data [66].
