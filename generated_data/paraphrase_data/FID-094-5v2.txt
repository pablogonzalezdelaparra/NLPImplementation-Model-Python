Scholars studying international relations have long highlighted the influence of popular culture on public perceptions and political reality. This article examines these possibilities in relation to videogames with a military theme and how weaponized artificial intelligence (AI) is portrayed in them. We identify distortions of human-machine interaction that contradict real-world scenarios within paradoxical videogame representations of AI weapons, both as easy targets that human protagonists routinely overcome in gameplay and as insurmountable enemies that pose existential threats to humankind in narratives. These fallacies center on the idea that videogames give players more agency over AI weaponry in order to provide fun gameplay, even if the same weapons are designed to reduce human agency in actual combat. We clarify how these skewed representations of AI weaponry are created by entanglements between diverse human and non-human actors that want to make videogames lucrative and mass-marketable by utilizing the Actor-Network Theory idea of translation. By doing this, we are in line with game studies research that demands that the commercial and ludic aspects of videogames be given more consideration so that international relations literature may more fully take into account pop cultures' limited capacity to influence public perceptions and political realities.
