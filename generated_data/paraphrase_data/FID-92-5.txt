The controversy surrounding the use of exergames in physical education (PE) courses and its impact on student performance in PE learning remains unresolved. This review examines the impact of exergames on student physical education (PE) learning and identifies the optimal circumstances for maximizing this impact. Following the PICOS method, two researchers conducted separate searches in the ProQuest, EBSCO, Web of Science (WoS), PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and VIP databases. They assessed the quality of the literature using the Cochrane system evaluation manual and conducted a meta-analysis of the included studies. This analysis comprised a total of 16 randomized controlled trials with 2962 patients. The meta-analysis demonstrated that exergames had a significant positive impact on student performance in physical education learning. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was 0.45, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.27 to 0.63, and a p-value of less than 0.00001. Subgroup analysis revealed that introducing exergames in small kindergarten groups and maintaining them for a duration of 1-2 months led to improved outcomes.
