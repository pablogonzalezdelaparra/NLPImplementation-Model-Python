Fuzzy logic is a highly effective method for optimizing power flow solutions, especially in the setting of deregulated power systems. The use of fuzzy logic controls allows for the determination of the optimal location of distribution generators (DGs), guaranteeing that reliability indices are recognized through optimal power flow solutions and fuzzy logic controllers to preserve system feasibility. Strategically positioning distribution generator units is vital in a deregulated power system to minimize power loss and improve overall system performance by reducing volatility. In a deregulated power system, it is crucial to have access to optimal power flow algorithms in order to detect areas of vulnerability, particularly within transmission companies. Both the transmission and distribution networks should be suitably modified to minimize congestion within their respective organizations. The aggregator is responsible for evaluating the efficiency of the electricity system by analyzing data provided by distribution and transmission businesses operating within the deregulated power system.
