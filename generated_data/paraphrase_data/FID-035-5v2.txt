The fourth industrial revolution and the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) will have a significant impact on the sustainability of the global automobile sector in the future. New industry standards such as more advanced self-driving technology, updated safety regulations, more intricate insurance policies, social resistance to technological change adapting to city infrastructure requirements with a digital divide, and disruptive business innovation based on strategic input supply partnerships with open-source AI are expected to drive the "new normal." This chapter examines the major components of autonomous vehicles (AVs) employing artificial intelligence (AI) advancements in radar and laser technology, commercial risk considerations, consumer behavior that drives itself, limitations imposed by municipal infrastructure, and societal adjustments to new technology. It is anticipated that the commercial, social, risk, infrastructure, and regulatory processes would interact in the future trajectory of the AV business, resulting in diverse effects on industry stakeholders. The findings of this study indicate that the following scenarios are most likely to sustain the AV industry: (1) AI-powered pulsed laser LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) with a sufficient loop frequency and GPS bi-directional cloud technology requirement; (2) pooled insurance as opposed to individual liability; (3) smart city infrastructure with an anticipated sharp digital divide across transport regions that will increase regional inequality; and (4) customers who strongly prefer a human-driven semi-autonomous vehicle over one driven entirely by machines.
