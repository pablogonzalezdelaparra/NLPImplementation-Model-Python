Ensuring the right amount of challenge in a game is crucial for maintaining player engagement. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) is a widely used method for enhancing player experience by automatically altering various features of the game. This paper examines the literature on processes used to adapt video game difficulty based on players' performance, emotions, or personality. To achieve this objective, we analyzed DDA research that utilized machine-learning methodologies, player modeling approaches, various data types to evaluate player states, testbed game genres, and applications. The data sources for this review consisted of journal and conference articles published until September 2022. The results indicate that the majority of research have demonstrated substantial impacts of DDA on factors such as pleasure, seamless experience, drive, involvement, and deep absorption. Furthermore, there has been a growing focus on incorporating machine-learning and player modeling approaches into the design of Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) systems. Nevertheless, due to the escalating utilization of games in diverse fields, further investigation is necessary to have a deeper understanding of player preferences in order to effectively modify game characteristics. By performing additional research on players' cognitive traits, such as visual attention, working memory, and response time, it will be feasible to gain a deeper understanding of players' preferences.
