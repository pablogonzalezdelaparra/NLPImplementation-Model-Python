The need for modern logistics and urban mobility has led to a steady growth in the number of cars on the road over the past several decades. Increased traffic congestion and traffic accidents are two of the numerous negative repercussions of additional automobiles on the road, which also limit economic progress. By lowering the dependency of automobiles on people, intelligent cars might greatly alleviate the aforementioned problems. Road vehicle automation has been spurred by substantial research undertaken by several nations over the past century. Every major motor manufacturer in the world is now working on developing autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. Undoubtedly, with the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the widespread deployment of driverless automobiles is closer than we may think. AI has become a critical component for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to enable them to sense their environment and make appropriate judgments in real time. The proliferation of big data from several sensing devices and state-of-the-art computational capabilities is propelling the development of AI. To understand AI's roles in AV systems, we must first look at its evolution and past.
