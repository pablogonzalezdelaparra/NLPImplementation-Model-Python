By emphasizing the ideas and technologies of Industry 4.0, which emphasize interconnection, digitization, and automation, it is ensured that micro- and macro-economic entities continue to expand. Within this framework, projects pertaining to Smart Production and Smart Logistics are considered to be greatly facilitated by artificial intelligence. This study does a thorough analysis of the scientific literature on deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence with a focus on smart logistics management in commercial settings. In addition, the authors present a conceptual framework based on the systematic literature review results, which offers valuable implications based on current research findings and insights to be used for initiating and directing future research initiatives in the fields of deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in smart logistics.
