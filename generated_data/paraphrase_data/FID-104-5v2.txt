In recent years, advances in machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence have completely changed the area of advanced robotics. The fields of advanced robotics are changing as a result of AI, ML, and DL, which are improving robot intelligence, efficiency, and ability to adapt to challenging jobs and surroundings. In advanced robotics, AI, ML, and DL are used in a variety of applications such as natural language processing, autonomous navigation, object identification and manipulation, and predictive maintenance. Collaborative robots, or cobots, are being developed using these technologies to work alongside people and adjust to changing jobs and circumstances. In order to give passengers and transportation businesses safety, efficiency, and convenience, sophisticated transportation systems can make use of AI, ML, and DL. Additionally, the development of factory assembly robots is greatly aided by AI, ML, and DL, which allows the robots to operate more effectively, safely, and intelligently. They also have a wide range of uses in aviation management, which aids airlines in increasing productivity, cutting expenses, and raising customer happiness. Additionally, taxi businesses may benefit from the use of AI, ML, and DL in order to provide their clients safer, better, and more effective services. The paper addresses several applications of the systems in robot modification and provides an overview of recent advances in AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics systems. To close the gaps between current studies and published papers, more study on the uses of AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics systems is also recommended. It is feasible to research and alter the performances of advanced robots in various applications in order to improve productivity in advanced robotic industries by analyzing the applications of AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics systems.
