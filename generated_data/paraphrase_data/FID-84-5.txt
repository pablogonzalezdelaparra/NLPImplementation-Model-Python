Remote healthcare solutions based on the Internet of Things (IoT) offer rapid and preventive medical treatments to individuals who are at danger. Nevertheless, forecasting cardiac disease is a complicated undertaking and diagnostic outcomes are seldom precise. A unique Recommendation System for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using IoT Network (DEEP-CARDIO) has been proposed to address this issue. It aims to provide before diagnosis, therapy, and nutrition recommendations for cardiac disorders. At first, the patient's physiological data are gathered remotely using four bio sensors: an ECG sensor, a pressure sensor, a pulse sensor, and a glucose sensor. An Arduino controller retrieves the gathered data from the IoT sensors in order to forecast and diagnose the illness. A cardiovascular disease prediction model is developed using the BiGRU (Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit) attention model to diagnose and classify cardiovascular diseases into five distinct categories. The recommendation system utilizes classified data to provide cardiac patients with activity and dietary suggestions using a mobile application. The DEEP-CARDIO's performance is verified through the utilization of Cloud Simulator (CloudSim) using the real-time Framingham's and Statlog heart disease dataset. The DEEP CARDIO approach obtains an accuracy of 99.90%, whereas the MABC-SVM, HCBDA, and MLbPM methods reach accuracies of 86.91%, 88.65%, and 93.63% respectively.
