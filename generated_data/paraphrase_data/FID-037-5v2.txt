There are many different aspects to the possibility for linked automated cars, and automated progress focuses on increasing the growth of the Internet of Things (IoTs) to facilitate artificial intelligence (AI). AI has been influenced by early developments in engineering, electronics, and many other domains. Numerous technological suggestions have been made for autonomous cars. Automated cars play a major role in reducing casualties and optimizing traffic. There are two types of development possible when it comes to investigating vehicle autonomy: one is backward subsystem progress, such as sensor and information processing systems, and the other involves high-level system integrations, such as new-energy cars and intelligent transportation systems. The outcomes of the Advanced Driver Assistance System are up to par with real-world automotive autonomous issues. Large-scale data collection from situational intelligence is taken into account while producing high-definition city maps, surveying land, and evaluating the state of roadways. With the aid of a camera, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR), and localization of the objects in the scene, the transport's infotainment system facilitates the driver's gesture recognition, language exchange, and perception of the surroundings. This chapter covers the background of autonomous vehicles (AV), current research topics in AV artificial intelligence technology, cutting edge datasets utilized in AV studies, and various ML/DL algorithms that make up the system's operation. It ends with the opportunities and challenges of AI in AV.
