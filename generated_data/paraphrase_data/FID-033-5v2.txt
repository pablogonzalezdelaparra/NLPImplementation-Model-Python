One of the newest technologies is artificial intelligence, which trains robots to think and behave like humans in order to emulate human intellect. An autonomous automobile is capable of operating on its own and performing essential tasks without the need for human intervention. With the use of this cutting-edge technology, there may be improvements in travel experiences, less traffic, less pollution, fewer clogged roads, and optimal traffic flow. In the fields of industry, agriculture, transportation, and military applications, autonomous vehicles are essential. A few artificial intelligence algorithms and sensor data assist the autonomous car in its operations. Data collecting, path planning, and execution in autonomous vehicles—all of which need for certain machine learning techniques—are examples of artificial intelligence. However, there are certain security and privacy risks associated with this. One major problem with autonomous cars is security. This article will discuss the developing field of self-driving car technology as well as the cybersecurity concerns associated with integrating artificial intelligence.
