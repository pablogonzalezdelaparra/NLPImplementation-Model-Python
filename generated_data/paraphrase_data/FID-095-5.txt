In scientific areas like as biomechanics, genetics, ethology, and neurology, it is crucial to precisely monitor the behavior of animals throughout investigations, especially without using markers. Nevertheless, it has been challenging to derive exact positions from constantly changing backgrounds. We have recently introduced a collection of tools that are open-source and utilize a state-of-the-art algorithm to estimate the position of humans. Using this toolbox, users can train a deep neural network to effectively monitor user-defined features with tracking accuracy comparable to that of human labeling. The redesigned Python package now includes additional capabilities like as graphical user interfaces (GUIs), efficiency enhancements, and network refinement through active learning. To assist customers in developing a distinct and replicable analysis pipeline utilizing a graphical processing unit (GPU).
