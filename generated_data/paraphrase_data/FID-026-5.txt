Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, Delhi, India, encountered a critical problem when almost 1,500 people who tested positive for COVID-19 disappeared. During public health emergencies, such as pandemics, natural disasters, or other calamities, hospitals and medical centers encounter a sudden surge of patients. Hospital management encounters challenges in effectively managing patient flow, particularly when patients need to be transferred between facilities or when new temporary healthcare facilities are established. These issues can lead to a rise in missing person situations. Patients may unintentionally be isolated from their family. The human face possesses a distinctive biometric system capable of ascertaining an individual's age, gender, mood, and even verifying their identity. Utilizing the capabilities of deep learning and artificial intelligence, computer vision plays a crucial role in Patient Identification. This study introduces an advanced patient face detection model that combines a twofold approach. The first component utilizes MTCNN, a cutting-edge multi-task cascaded convolution neural network, for face detection and alignment. The second component employs FaceNet, a well-known convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm for face embedding. Finally, a KNN algorithm is used as a classifier to achieve an impressive accuracy rate of 97.1%. In order to prioritize public safety during the pandemic, we have developed a Resnet34 model specifically designed for detecting masks. This model has been trained using the Face Mask Detection dataset and has achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 97%. This work not only focuses on the urgent issues related to patient identification and safety during crises, but also has implications for wider healthcare applications. The offered models present potential opportunities for improving patient care and security.
