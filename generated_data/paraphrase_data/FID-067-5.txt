This paper introduces the concept of self-reproduction in Artificial Life and its application to computer animation. An Artificial Fish model that can reproduce itself, based on gene control, is proposed and constructed. The chromosome of the Artificial Fish contains the genetic information that determines its phenotype. According to this paradigm, hereditary rules are provided. Artificial Fish have the ability to reproduce and grow inside a virtual marine environment that is under the precise control of a gene model and set of regulations. Artificial behaviors encompass both predetermined behaviors and indeterminate behaviors. Artificial Intelligence-based cognitive models are proposed and developed to regulate the actions of artificial fish at a high level. The simulation program is created using the models provided earlier. These efforts laid the foundation for enhancing the efficiency and automation of artificial fish animation.
