Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are anticipated to revolutionize future transportation systems, with decision making being a crucial component for achieving advanced automated driving. Data-driven decision-making approaches have gained increased attention as a solution to complex circumstances that rule-based methods struggle to handle well. The selection of datasets for data-driven approaches has a significant impact on decision-making performance. Therefore, it is crucial to thoroughly understand the available datasets. When considering the sources of collected data, driving data may be categorized into three types: vehicle-related data, environment-related data, and driver-related data. This study conducts a comparison of the most advanced datasets in three categories and provides a concise summary of their characteristics, such as the types of sensors employed, the methods of annotation, and the driving scenarios involved. This survey examines the properties of datasets and explores their potential uses in many elements of AV decision making. It aims to help researchers choose suitable datasets to support their own research. An overview of the forthcoming patterns in the evolution of AV datasets is provided.
