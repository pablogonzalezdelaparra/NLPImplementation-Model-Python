The number of published research in the topic has expanded in tandem with the growing usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in education. Nevertheless, no extensive evaluations that thoroughly examine the several facets of this topic have been carried out. We use topic-based bibliometrics to address this gap by identifying trends and issues relevant to AI applications in education (AIEd) based on 4,519 articles from 2000 to 2019. Based on the review's findings, the academic community is becoming more and more interested in applying AI in education. Personalized learning recommender systems, natural language processing for language education, educational robots for AI education, intelligent tutoring systems for special education, educational data mining for performance prediction, discourse analysis in computer-supported collaborative learning, neural networks for teaching evaluation, and affective computing for learner emotion detection are among the main research topics. We also talk about AIEd's future directions and obstacles.
