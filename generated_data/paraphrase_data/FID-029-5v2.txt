In addition to expanding the population, a bigger consumer base means more work and resources are required to meet the demands of these ever growing numbers of customers. Why not this one? After all, technology is employed to fix all of the issues. The goal is to provide a more sophisticated and convenient super market experience where customers may purchase without fuss and without having to wait in line or see cashiers. In order to automate a supermarket and increase productivity, this project makes use of artificial intelligence and the internet of things. After scanning their QR code via the smartphone bearing their unique ID, a person only has to go in. It will keep track of the customer's arrival at the store. Sensors on the shopping carts and baskets allow them to recognize when a product is being put in or removed. The goods are arranged on shelves equipped with pressure sensors, which sense when a product is lifted. Your shopping cards are the only way to unlock these restricted shelves. All you have to do is swipe your card once again at the counter to get money taken out of your account in accordance with what you bought, and you'll receive a receipt. With a small one-time investment, we want to supply this technology to several super market chains both domestically and outside.
