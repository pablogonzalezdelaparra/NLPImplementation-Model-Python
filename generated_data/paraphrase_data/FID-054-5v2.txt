A sizable number of clinical cases conducted since the 1950s have attested to the value of art in psychiatric and rehabilitative therapy. The development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the development of AI painting software that uses feedback and prompts to create images based on the Stable Diffusion algorithm paradigm. Thus, a crucial consideration for AI painting software's use in art therapy is whether or not it can enhance human emotions. Using techniques for measuring emotional lexicon, this study monitors and assesses the emotional changes that patients experience both before and after using the AI painting program Stable Diffusion WebUI. The project's experimental data suggests that artificial intelligence painting can have a favorable emotional impact on people. This finding creates new opportunities for combining artificial intelligence with art therapy research. On the one hand, it makes it possible to construct guided AI painting software in-depth, which is especially useful for art therapyâ€”a type of AI software that uses art to cure. Conversely, it promotes more investigation into the workings of AI-assisted painting vs conventional painting in art therapy, with the goal of learning more about the fundamental ideas and workings of art therapy.
