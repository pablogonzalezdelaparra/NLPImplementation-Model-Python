In regular traffic, how would individuals divide the risks associated with autonomous vehicles (AVs)? The extensive body of research on the morality of autonomous vehicles (AVs) centers on moral assessments of situations in which collisions are inevitable. We make the case for expanding the discussion to driving practices in regular traffic situations, where ethical dilemmas are constantly raised by the ongoing transfer of risk among users. We measured participants' preferences on driving maneuvers of AVs in a representative survey in Germany using an interactive, graphical representation of different traffic situations. This distribution of risks raises ethically relevant questions that cannot be avoided by simple heuristics like "hitting the brakes." The choices of our participants were far from just avoiding collisions. It's interesting to note that our participants were prepared to assume personal risks in order to help other drivers, which implies that the social conundrum raised by AVs may be lessened in hazardous situations. Through our study, engineers and philosophers may be able to have more fruitful conversations on the ethics of autonomous vehicles.
