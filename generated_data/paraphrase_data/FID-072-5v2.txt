A method of evaluating a mobile application's usability that makes use of fuzzy logic principles is called fuzzy logic-based quantification of usability expectation for an m-commerce mobile application. Any mobile application's usability may be used to analyze the expectations and preferences of the user to determine how the application meets their needs. There is never a better option for quantification than fuzzy logic. The user experience of an m-commerce mobile application is evaluated using fuzzy logic-based quantification of usability expectation, which takes into consideration the requirements, preferences, and expectations of the user. The degree to which the program satisfies the user's expectations, the user's ability to comprehend and engage with it, and their overall level of happiness with it are all included in the usability expectation. The developers may make the required adjustments for a better user experience by using this technique to help identify areas that need improvement. This study uses fuzzy logic to quantify the overall usability quality of a mobile m-commerce application after presenting the creation of a usability metric framework. The goal of the suggested usability metric framework, which is based on the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) methodology, is to offer a thorough and organized method for creating metrics that evaluate the qualitative aspects of mobile apps. The framework offers a set of quantifiable criteria to measure m-commerce mobile applications in accordance with standards. It was designed and tested in an m-commerce scenario. The evaluation's findings may then be applied to enhance mobile m-commerce apps and guarantee that the user experience is optimal.
