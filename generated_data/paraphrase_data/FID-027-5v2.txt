One of the cornerstones of positive psychology is well-being, which is well-known to have good impacts on people's personal and professional life as well as on teams and organizations. Staff health and long-term success depend on understanding and promoting individual well-being, but the methods currently in use to measure subjective well-being are laborious surveys and questionnaires that make it difficult to provide the kind of immediate feedback that is necessary to shift individual behavior and raise awareness. In order to find important determinants of individual well-being in cooperation, this research uses video data to present a framework for understanding the process of nonverbal communication in teamwork. It uses cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques in conjunction with video capture technology to extract individual, relative, and environmental features from panoramic video. Each time series is subjected to statistical analysis, producing a dataset of 125 variables. These features are then connected to questionnaires known as PERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishments), which were created within the framework of positive psychology. Using machine learning methods, each pillar of the PERMA model is assessed as a regression or classification issue. Our method was used in a case study where 80 students worked together in 20 teams for a week in person on a team project. This made it possible for us to develop a number of theories about the variables affecting each person's well-being while working in a team. These encouraging findings suggest intriguing study directions, such as merging various media to analyze teamwork-related individual well-being.
