The world is changing significantly due to artificial intelligence (AI); although there are undoubtedly positive effects from the technology, there may also be broad and long-lasting negative effects. AI is being incorporated into many facets of human life, and the complicated ethical issues that have arisen from its development, application, and use serve as a reminder that it is time to review the AI-related lessons that professionals and upcoming developers and designers are learning. It is crucial to prepare upcoming AI community members and other stakeholders to consider how AI could affect people's lives and to accept their responsibility to maximize its advantages while minimizing its possible drawbacks. This may happen in part as a result of AI ethics being taught in the curriculum in a more thorough and organized manner. In this work, we provide an overview of several perspectives on AI ethics and provide a set of suggestions for AI ethics education.
