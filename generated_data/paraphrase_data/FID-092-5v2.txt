It is still debatable if using exergames in physical education (PE) classes can greatly increase student performance in the subject. This review investigates the ways in which exergames might enhance student learning of physical education as well as its promotional influence. Two researchers independently searched the ProQuest, EBSCO, Web of Science (WoS), PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and VIP databases using the PICOS method. They then assessed the quality of the included literature using the Cochrane system evaluation manual and conducted a meta-analysis of the included literature. This analysis comprised a total of 16 randomized controlled trials with 2962 participants. Exergames significantly increased student performance in PE learning, according to the meta-analysis (SMD = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.27â€“0.63, P < 0.00001). A subgroup study revealed that using exergames for a duration of 1-2 months in small kindergarten groups might provide superior outcomes.
