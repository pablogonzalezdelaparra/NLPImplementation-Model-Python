The goal of smart cities is to enhance the quality of life for city inhabitants by combining information and communication technology (ICT) with urban management. Within this framework, recommender systems—tools that provide urban residents with tailored recommendations—have become important agents of this convergence. Their capacity to interpret large volumes of data generated in urban environments and their effective use in a variety of sectors of city life have hastened their standing as a significant technology in the evolution of city planning. Among the methods we used was a review of the Web of Science database, which produced 130 papers. These were then whittled down to 86 by applying relevance filters. First, a bibliometric study was conducted with the aim of using the SciMAT tool to analyze structural characteristics. Second, the PRISMA 2020 declaration was used to conduct a systematic evaluation of the literature. The findings demonstrated the many methods used to filter suggestions in fields including travel, health, mobility, and transportation. This study is seen as a major breakthrough that will help smart cities develop and become more efficient. It will also provide a strong foundation for further research in this rapidly expanding sector.
