This study presents an experiment including the utilization of an Artificial Life competitive game to replicate an environment for teaching Artificial Intelligence (AI) to computer science engineering students in an unstructured and informal manner. The game has a virtual Petri dish in which two colonies of microorganisms, represented as software agents, must compete for survival. In order to accomplish this objective, the participants must employ survival tactics for their agents, which encompass combat methods and fundamental reproduction guidelines to overcome the entire artificial environment. The contest's technical foundations and the artificial life model's description are provided in thorough detail. This text discusses the pedagogical experience gained from developing the contest, as well as the resulting learning experience. The learning experience has produced enthusiasm among students and has aided in the construction of mental models for potential AI algorithms.
