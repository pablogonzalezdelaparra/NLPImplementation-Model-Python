With the advancement of both education and technology, educators have come to understand that games shouldn't be limited to students' personal amusement. Better learning results can be obtained by integrating games into instructional materials. On the other hand, relevant materials are continually appearing online. A knowledge graph-based personalized recommendation strategy for instructional video game materials is suggested in order to produce recommendations of a higher caliber. First, feature extraction is done on both the object and user sides in turn. Next, a hidden Markov model based on the dual end neighbor technique is shown. The model is optimized taking into account the user's temporal characteristics. The optimized model mines users' prospective preferences while accounting for their short- and long-term preferences. The developed model's hit rate index value is determined to be 0.7989 by experimental research. The broken line's adjusted cumulative gain value is 0.6045. Over 89% of people are happy with this model's suggestion. The duration is 0.2863 seconds. Users will have a more convenient and effective online experience with the built-in model's ability to propose instructional video game resources in an efficient and high-quality manner.
