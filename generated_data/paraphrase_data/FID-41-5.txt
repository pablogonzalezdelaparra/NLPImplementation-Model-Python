Empathy computing is a developing area of research that combines artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technology to forecast, detect, simulate, and produce human empathy. This discipline expands upon psychological research by exploring the concepts, measures, brain underpinnings, and practical uses of empathy. It also utilizes cutting-edge computational methods to analyze and simulate empathy. This article provides a thorough evaluation of the existing studies on empathy computing and explores its future prospects from a psychological standpoint. The objective is to support fundamental research and real-world implementations in this domain. The current research on empathy computing can be classified into four distinct themes, each focusing on different objectives and employing various methodologies. Empathy computing focuses on the analysis and understanding of empathy using computers. This undertaking can be further categorized into two distinct groups: (1) individual empathy evaluation, which centers on scrutinizing individual empathetic characteristics, and (2) empathetic content categorization, which centers on studying empathetic attributes in texts rather than individuals. Additionally, research also concentrates on the simulation and expression of empathy through computing. This encompasses the creation of empathetic response systems and the advancement of generative empathetic dialogue systems. The former offers users a restricted set of predetermined rule-based responses and feedback to convey empathy, whereas the latter use artificial intelligence to automatically develop a diverse array of sympathetic dialogues without depending on predetermined rules. These four research streams are distinct but also work well together. Furthermore, as research advances, new avenues will continue to arise, such as enhancing the empathetic abilities of computers through brain-computer interface technology. While empathy computing research is still in its nascent stages, it has demonstrated potential for groundbreaking applications in areas such as mental health, education, business services, and public management. As artificial intelligence becomes more common, fields that need a lot of human-computer contact are likely to become the key areas where this interaction takes place. Consequently, they become the primary use cases for empathy computing. Empathy computing can be utilized in the field of mental health to automatically assess and improve therapists' empathetic skills. Furthermore, it has the capability to offer individualized compassionate assistance and direction through chatbots powered by artificial intelligence. Empathy computing in education can enhance the learning process through the utilization of empathetic AI instructors. Within the commercial sector, it allows firms to provide customized customer experiences, thereby improving happiness and promoting loyalty through the creation of empathetic conversations. Empathy computing can be employed in public management to generate discourse that is empathetic in order to counterbalance negative speech. Furthermore, it enables policymakers to effectively and compassionately address the demands and inquiries of individuals, so promoting trust and confidence in the government. These four scenarios demonstrate the extensive range of possible uses for empathy computing. Nevertheless, the current impracticability of relying solely on computers to carry out sympathetic duties is mostly attributed to safety and ethical considerations. However, it is imperative to establish a partnership between humans and computers. Empathy computing serves as a groundbreaking frontier, offering not only means to quantitatively and comprehensively assess empathy on a bigger scope, but also enhancing the theoretical framework of empathy research. This study expands upon conventional research on empathy in interpersonal relationships to investigate its growing expressions in human-AI relationships. This extension presents new inquiries into the widespread existence of empathy and its possible development in human-computer interaction. Empathy computing has the potential to become a fundamental element of a comprehensive theory of empathy that includes many types of relationship dynamics, spanning from interactions between humans to interactions between humans and machines, and even more. For a thorough understanding of empathy and its effective promotion in an intelligent society, it is advantageous to concentrate future research on creating comprehensive theoretical models of empathy computing, constructing dependable datasets that encompass psychological and behavioral traits related to empathy, and validating and improving empathy computing research using a human-centered approach. Psychologists are essential in guiding, assessing, and enhancing research and practice in this subject. The partnership between researchers in psychology and computer science is crucial to guarantee that AI acquires empathy in a proficient and ethical manner, ultimately promoting the wellness of individuals in the future intelligent society.
