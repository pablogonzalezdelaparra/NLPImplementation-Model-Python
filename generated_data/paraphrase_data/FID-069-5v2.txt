This study describes an artificial life competitive game that mimics an artificial life setting and is used to educate artificial intelligence (AI) in an unstructured, casual manner to students pursuing professions in computer science and engineering. on the game, two colonies of software agents, or microbes, must fight to live on a replicated Petri dish. In order to win over the whole artificial environment, the players must adopt fundamental reproduction laws and combat techniques for their agents in order to accomplish this aim. A thorough explanation of the artificial life model and the technological foundations of the competition are provided. We talk about the pedagogical experience gained during the contest creation and the subsequent learning experience that sparked students' interest and assisted them in creating mental models of potential AI algorithms.
