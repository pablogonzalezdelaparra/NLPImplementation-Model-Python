Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a game-changer in a number of industries, including healthcare and medicine. With prompts, large language models such as ChatGPT produce writing that appears human. This highlights the promise of AI. The flexibility of ChatGPT has the potential to transform healthcare procedures, enhance patient care, and improve communication between medical staff, patients, and data. ChatGPT quickly distributes important information related to pandemic management. It facilitates dental procedures, streamlines medical education, acts as a virtual assistant for surgical consultations, and helps diagnose illnesses. Eight major categories were used to group the 82 papers: G1 covers treatment and medicine; G2 covers buildings and equipment; G3 covers disease-related parts of the human body; G4 covers patients; G5 includes citizens; G6 covers cellular imaging, radiology, pulse, and medical images; G7 includes doctors and nurses; and G8 includes tools, devices, and administration. It's still difficult to strike a balance between AI and human judgment. The PRISMA method was used to conduct a systematic literature review that examined the transformational potential of AI in healthcare, emphasizing ChatGPT's many uses, constraints, drive, and difficulties. In conclusion, ChatGPT's wide range of medical applications show off its inventiveness and make it an invaluable tool for scholars, students, and healthcare researchers. This study also acts as a guide, helping scholars, researchers, and students in the medical and healthcare fields.
