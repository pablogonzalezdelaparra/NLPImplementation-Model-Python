Because they mimic real-life issues and circumstances, serious video games offer an immersive learning environment for farmers. However, there is little actual data to support their efficacy. In order to highlight research trends and identify gaps, this scoping review summarizes the literature on serious video games for agricultural learning in accordance with PRISMA-ScR principles. In order to find publications on serious video games for agriculture learning published between January 2000 and July 2022, we conducted a thorough search across nine reputable academic databases. Data extraction, screening, and narrative synthesis of the gathered data were carried out by two impartial reviewers. 3,297 articles were found in the first search; of these, 0.58% (n = 19) were included in the review. The majority of the games that have been evaluated were launched during the previous five years, mostly on mobile platforms. They frequently used a simulation-based methodology, had two-dimensional visuals, and were intended for single-player gameplay. These games, which emphasize agricultural production and sustainable agriculture, are primarily aimed at students. The research frequently lacked specific educational philosophies. Pilot studies were the main component of evaluation methods, with an emphasis on improving knowledge and user experience. These studies frequently showed positive effects, including enhanced user experiences, knowledge, and changes in attitude and behavior. This report showcases developments over the past 20 years in the use of serious video games for agricultural education. It does, however, emphasize the necessity of more research on how game aspects affect user experience and efficacy. Improving theoretical underpinnings and instructional strategies is crucial, as is developing games for players from marginalized groups and with particular farming difficulties. For the purpose of evaluating game efficacy over the short, medium, and long terms, rigorous study designs are essential.
