The tourist business has been overtaken by artificial intelligence chatbots because of their great efficiency and low cost. Researchers haven't paid much attention to how chatbots' emotional expressions affect customer outcomes, though. Using three trials and the expectation violations theory, we investigated how chatbot emotional expressions impact consumer pleasure when it comes to recommending tourism attractions. By lowering expectation breaches, chatbots' compassionate displays of concern for users might raise customer satisfaction levels. The negative association between emotional expressiveness and expectancy violation can be moderated, in particular, by the customer's goal orientation, the human-likeness of chatbot avatars, and the sort of interaction that exists between consumers and chatbots. These results contribute to the understanding of chatbot emotional expressions and offer important information for using chatbots in tourist customer care.
