Future transportation networks are anticipated to be drastically altered by autonomous vehicles (AVs), and one of the key components of high-level automated driving is decision-making. Data-driven decision-making techniques have drawn increased attention in an effort to handle those complex situations that rule-based systems were unable to adequately handle. A thorough understanding of the current datasets is therefore required, as they have a significant impact on the performance of decision making when utilized to construct data-driven techniques. Driving data may be categorized into three categories based on the sources from which it was collected: vehicle, environment, and driver. This study outlines the aspects, such as driving situations, annotation, and sensors employed, and compares the state-of-the-art datasets of these three categories. This survey also addresses prospective uses of datasets on different AV decision making elements based on the datasets' properties, helping academics choose relevant datasets to support their own work. A summary of the AV dataset development's future patterns is provided.
