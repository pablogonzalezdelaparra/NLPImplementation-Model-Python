The current endeavor in providing computing resources as a service to managers and consumers signifies a departure from computing as a product that is bought, to computing as a service that is provided to users over the internet from extensive data centers. Nevertheless, the emergence of cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) has led to significant advancements in automating customer experiences across various domains, such as recommender systems (RS). Consequently, there is a growing demand for modifications to accommodate IoT devices, which play a central role in automation. This includes recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard, as well as technologies like nanotechnology. This study presents the marketing community with a new advancement in computing called IoT-driven fog computing (FC). While there have been several research studies on FC "smart" applications, none of them have focused on fog-based smart marketing domains like recommender systems. FC is regarded as an innovative computational system that can reduce latency and enhance bandwidth usage for autonomous consumer behavior applications that necessitate real-time data-driven decision making. This paper presents a theoretical framework for examining the impact of fog computing on consumer behavior. The objective is to encourage further research by utilizing the combination of fog computing and recommendation systems as an illustrative case. Our conceptualization of "fog-based recommender systems" presents new and challenging opportunities for academic research. Some of these opportunities are discussed in the later part of this paper. Keywords: fog computing, recommender system, internet of things (IoT), edge computing, artificial intelligence (AI), software defined networks (SDNs).
