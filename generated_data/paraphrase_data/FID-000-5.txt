This study conducted a content analysis of research studies that have examined the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the education sector. The study also aimed to identify possible research trends and difficulties related to the use of AI in education. A total of 100 papers, comprising 63 empirical papers (consisting of 74 studies) and 37 analytic papers, were chosen from the education and educational research category of the Social Sciences Citation Index database for the period of 2010 to 2020. The content analysis revealed that the research questions could be categorized into three layers: the development layer, which includes classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning; the application layer, which encompasses feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning; and the integration layer, which involves affection computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and gamification. Furthermore, it was recommended to conduct further research on four emerging areas of study: Internet of Things, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience. Additionally, an evaluation of the application of artificial intelligence in education was proposed. However, we have also suggested that the obstacles in education may arise from the improper application of AI techniques, the shifting roles of instructors and students, and the presence of social and ethical concerns. The results offer valuable insights into the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of education. This research strengthens the theoretical basis of AI in education and presents a promising opportunity for educators and AI engineers to engage in additional collaborative research.
