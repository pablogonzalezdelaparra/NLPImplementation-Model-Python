The term artificial intelligence (AI) has gained a lot of traction recently due to revolutionary developments in technology and remarkable experimental outcomes, particularly in the area of image processing and analysis. Specialties in medicine that rely heavily on pictures, such as radiology, pathology, or cancer, have taken advantage of this and invested significant resources in research and development to bring AI's promise to clinical settings. As artificial intelligence (AI) gains popularity for common medical imaging analytic tasks including diagnosis, segmentation, and classification, knowledgeable practitioners are crucial to the safe and effective usage of clinical AI applications. This review's objective is to outline the fundamental technological underpinnings of artificial intelligence (AI), as well as cutting-edge machine learning techniques and how they relate to medical imaging. We also talk about the newest developments and potential paths for future study. This will make it easier for the reader to comprehend how AI techniques are now a necessary part of every workflow for medical image processing and open the door for the application of AI-based solutions in clinical settings.
