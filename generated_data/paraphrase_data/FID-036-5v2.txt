The combination of sophisticated AI capabilities and human-centric design will determine the direction of autonomous cars in the future. In the future, autonomous cars will not only carry people, but will also communicate with them and adjust to their needs, resulting in a more efficient, enjoyable, and comfortable ride. In this study, we provide a novel framework to improve the decision-making process of autonomous cars by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework aims to seamlessly integrate the advanced language and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into autonomous vehicles by integrating their natural language abilities and contextual understanding, using specialized tools, synergizing reasoning, and acting with various modules on autonomous vehicles. By providing individualized support, ongoing learning, and transparent decision-making, the suggested framework has the potential to completely transform how autonomous cars function and eventually lead to the development of safer and more effective autonomous driving technology.
