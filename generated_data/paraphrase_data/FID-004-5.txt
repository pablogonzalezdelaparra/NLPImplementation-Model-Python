Artificial Intelligence (AI) is significantly transforming the world, with both positive and negative consequences. The incorporation of AI into different facets of human existence is currently in progress, and the intricate moral issues arising from the creation, implementation, and utilization of this technology serve as a prompt to reevaluate the educational curriculum for future AI developers, designers, and professionals. Training future members of the AI community, as well as other stakeholders, to consider the possible influence of AI on people's lives and to accept responsibility for maximizing its advantages while minimizing its potential downsides is extremely important. One way to achieve this is by including AI ethics more comprehensively and methodically into the curriculum. This study provides a concise overview of several approaches to AI ethics and presents a series of recommendations for the teaching of AI ethics.
