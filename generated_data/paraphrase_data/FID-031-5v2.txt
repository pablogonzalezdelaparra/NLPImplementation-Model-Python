Nonetheless, it is generally believed that accurate trajectory tracking will make motion planning algorithm design easier, even if this is not practical in real-world situations. By coordinating the motion planning layer and controller, a secure and dependable framework for motion planning and control is presented in this research to address tracking problems resulting from imprecise tracking. In particular, the repulsive potential field is constructed by constructing the movement constraint size based on tracking error, dividing motion space into safe and dangerous zones. The suggested waypoint set filtering technique combined with global search can then yield the collision-free waypoint set. An optimization-based method that reduces the reference trajectory's acceleration is used to suit the planned trajectory. The intended course is then examined and adjusted by the anti-collision modification to guarantee safety. Even in the event of actuator failures, transient trajectory tracking errors may be kept within the intended region by employing invertible transformation and adaptive compensation. Under incorrect tracking and actuator problems, safety and reliability may be ensured by the coordination between the planning and control levels because tracking error is taken into account and margined at the planning level. Simulation and experimental findings validate the benefits and efficacy of the suggested motion planning and control system.
