Investigating the efficacy of recommender systems in knowledge discovery was the main goal of the study. approach: A desktop research approach was used in this study. Secondary data, or data that may be gathered without fieldwork, is referred to as desk research. Since desk research mostly entails gathering data from already-existing resources—executives' time, phone bills, and directories—it is frequently seen as a less expensive method than field research. As a result, the study used data, reports, and studies that have already been published. It was simple to obtain this secondary data by using the library and internet journals. Conclusions: The conclusions show that there is a methodological and contextual gap concerning recommender systems in knowledge discovery. According to a research on recommender systems' usefulness in knowledge discovery, these systems are essential for helping users explore large amounts of information so they may find pertinent resources and learn more. It was discovered that recommender systems using sophisticated algorithms and customized methods were more successful in producing pertinent recommendations that were catered to the interests and requirements of users. Furthermore, the study emphasized the significance of encouraging active user participation in the recommendation process by highlighting the favorable association between user engagement indicators and knowledge discovery outcomes. It was also discovered that contextual information had a critical role in determining how effective recommendations were. In summary, the study emphasised how important it is to continuously improve and optimise recommender system algorithms in order to improve user outcomes when it comes to information discovery. Special Contribution to Theory, Practice, and Policy: Future research on recommender systems in knowledge discovery may be anchored by the Social Learning, Information Foraging, and Cognitive Load theories. Recommendations for improving the effectiveness of such systems were given by the research. It recommended using hybrid recommender systems, which combine content-based and collaborative filtering methods to provide recommendations that are more varied and accurate. The study also underlined how crucial it is to incorporate contextual data into recommendation algorithms so that suggestions may be constantly modified in response to situational circumstances. In order to increase recommendation processes' transparency and consumer comprehension, it also suggested using explainable AI methodologies. In order to promote exploration and the accidental discovery of new information resources, it was also emphasized how important it is to prioritize suggestion diversity and maximize user interaction through active participation and feedback.
