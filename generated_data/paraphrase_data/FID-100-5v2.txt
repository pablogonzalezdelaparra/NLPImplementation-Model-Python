The advent of deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in recent years has brought about a dramatic shift in the way of living in modern civilization. Artificial intelligence is a multifaceted technology that includes ML, DL, and sophisticated algorithms, among other components. In the near future, ophthalmologists should be able to use automated devices from AI, ML, and DL to diagnose and treat eye problems promptly. In fact, intraocular lens calculations, image reading, corneal topography mapping, and illness diagnostic validation have all been accomplished in the ophthalmology field using AI, ML, and DL. Globally, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are the three most prevalent causes of permanent blindness. Many diseases, including as DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ocular ailments, may be objectively diagnosed and their course can be tracked by ophthalmic imaging. In ophthalmic practice, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus digital photography are the two imaging modalities employed for diagnostic purposes. Notably, OCT has emerged as the most used imaging modality in developed world ophthalmology settings. The need for these pictures is growing due to changes in the population's demography and lifestyle, an increase in average lifespan, and shifts in the prevalence of chronic illnesses such glaucoma, diabetes, DR, AMD, and obesity. Additionally, a significant issue in many nations is the scarcity of retina experts and qualified human graders. As a result, it is obvious that processing such photos will be expensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error given the present trends in population increase. Consequently, it will become unavoidable in the near future to use unmanned automated applications systems for the diagnosis and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ocular illnesses. We give a summary of the possible effects of the existing AI, ML, and DL techniques and their applications on ocular illness early diagnosis and therapy, including glaucoma, AMD, DR, and glaucoma.
