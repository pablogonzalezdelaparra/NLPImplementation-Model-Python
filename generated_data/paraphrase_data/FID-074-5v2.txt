This paper investigates voltage stability in a PV-based DC microgrid using a fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The microgrid is composed of loads, a DC-DC converter, and many photovoltaic (PV) modules. Because PV electricity is often used intermittently, voltage stability is a critical and challenging issue for DC microgrids. This paper suggests an FLC-based voltage control method that determines the optimal course of action for maintaining the voltage stability of the system by utilizing input elements such as PV output power, DC-DC converter duty cycle, and load current. Simulation is used to evaluate the FLC's performance, and it is designed to be robust to errors and changes in the parameters. The simulation results show that across a range of operating conditions, such as fluctuating solar irradiance and load changes, the proposed FLC-based control method successfully maintains the microgrid's voltage stability. Additionally, the FLC outperforms alternative control strategies.
