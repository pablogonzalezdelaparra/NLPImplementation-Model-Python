Industry 4.0 encompasses concepts and technology that promote the continuous growth of both small-scale and large-scale economic entities through the principles of interconnectedness, digitalization, and automation. Artificial intelligence is considered a significant facilitator for Smart Logistics and Smart Production activities in this particular environment. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of the scientific literature on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning as they relate to the management of Smart Logistics in industrial businesses. In addition, the authors of the systematic literature review present a conceptual framework that offers valuable implications derived from recent research findings and insights. This framework can be used to guide and initiate future research endeavors in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) in the context of Smart Logistics.
