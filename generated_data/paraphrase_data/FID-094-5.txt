International relations studies has consistently highlighted the significant influence of popular culture on public perceptions and political dynamics. This article examines the possibilities of military-themed video games and how they depict weaponized artificial intelligence (AI). In paradoxical depictions of AI weapons in video games, they are portrayed both as formidable enemies that pose existential threats to humanity in the game's storylines, and as easy targets that human protagonists effortlessly defeat during gameplay. These representations create distortions in the way humans interact with machines, which do not align with real-world scenarios. These distortions arise from the fact that videogames empower players with increased control over AI weaponry, allowing them to dominate and enjoy the gameplay. This contradicts the original purpose of these weapons, which is to reduce human control on real-world battlefields. We elucidate the production of these inaccurate depictions of AI weaponry by examining the entanglements between diverse human and non-human actors, utilizing the idea of translation from the Actor-Network Theory. These entanglements are driven by the objective of making video games widely marketable and financially lucrative. By doing this, we are aligning with game studies research that emphasizes the need to focus more on the commercial and playful aspects of video games. This will enable international relations academics to more effectively analyze how popular cultures can influence public perceptions and political situations.
