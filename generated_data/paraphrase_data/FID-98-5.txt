As education and technology have advanced, teachers have come to recognize that games should have a purpose beyond just entertainment for children. Utilizing gamification in educational materials can lead to improved teaching results. Nevertheless, new resources that are connected to the topic are consistently appearing on the internet. A personalized recommendation strategy for educational video game resources based on knowledge graphs is developed to enhance the quality of recommendations. Firstly, feature extraction is carried out in an alternating manner on both the user side and the item side. Next, a hidden Markov model is shown using the dual end neighbor technique as a foundation. Given the user's temporal characteristics, the model is optimized. The optimized model considers both the enduring and immediate preferences of users and extracts their latent preferences. By doing experimental analysis, the hit rate index value of the designed model achieves a score of 0.7989. The broken line has a normalized cumulative gain value of 0.6045. The satisfaction rate for the suggestion of this model exceeds 89%. The duration of the operating process is 0.2863 seconds. The developed methodology may successfully achieve effective and top-notch suggestion of instructional video game resources, offering consumers a more convenient and efficient online experience.
