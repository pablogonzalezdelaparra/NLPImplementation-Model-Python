The domain of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is extensive. There is a wide array of both individual and collaborative AI-based solutions that are currently accessible. One example of such technology is computer vision. Computer vision is closely connected to various other technologies such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and artificial neural networks. Computer vision is utilized in various domains. Healthcare has seen widespread application in recent decades. Healthcare utilizes algorithms in the aforementioned technologies to extract relevant information from medical photos. This chapter provides an overview of computer vision, including its various applications and its specific use in the healthcare industry. Furthermore, we will examine the case of tumor identification using computer vision in a MATLAB environment.
