The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) has the potential to completely revolutionize the delivery of healthcare. AI-powered computer vision can be utilized for medical image analysis, disease identification, patient health tracking, surgical support, speeding up drug development, and developing personalized treatment plans. The utilization of AI-assisted computer vision in healthcare offers several benefits, including enhanced diagnosis, reduced expenses, customized treatment, improved patient outcomes, and expedited drug discovery. Nevertheless, the utilization of these technologies also poses challenges in regards to data privacy, bias, and legal issues. This chapter explores several applications of computer vision in healthcare systems, such as medical picture analysis, disease diagnosis, movement and gait analysis, surgical support, behavioral analysis, and medicine development. The chapter also addresses the challenges associated with implementing computer vision in healthcare, such as data privacy issues, bias, legal considerations, limited accessibility, and the intricacies of biological systems. In summary, the utilization of AI-assisted computer vision in healthcare systems has the potential to greatly transform the industry by facilitating faster and more precise diagnosis, improving patient results, and reducing expenses. In order to ensure the ethical and responsible use of these technologies, it is imperative to tackle the associated concerns.
