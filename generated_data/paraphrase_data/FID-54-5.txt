Since the 1950s, numerous clinical instances have provided evidence of the efficacy of art in rehabilitative therapy and psychiatric therapies. The progress of artificial intelligence technology has led to the development of AI painting software that utilizes the Stable Diffusion algorithm paradigm. This software allows for the production of images by using prompts and receiving feedback. Consequently, the potential of AI painting software to have a beneficial influence on human emotions is a crucial consideration for its use in art therapy. This study monitors and quantifies the emotional fluctuations in patients prior to and following their utilization of the AI painting software Stable Diffusion WebUI, employing techniques for measuring emotional lexicon. Based on the empirical evidence from this project, it has been observed that artificial intelligence painting has the ability to elicit a favorable impact on human emotions. This outcome presents a novel opportunity for the fusion of artificial intelligence and art therapy research. On one side, it enables the comprehensive advancement of specialized artificial intelligence painting software that is specifically tailored as a dedicated tool for art therapy, a type of AI software used for creative healing. Conversely, it promotes additional investigation into the efficacy of traditional painting compared to AI-assisted painting in the field of art therapy, with the goal of examining the fundamental principles and mechanisms of art therapy.
