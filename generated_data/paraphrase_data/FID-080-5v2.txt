Modern technology and easy access to the internet have led to an abundance of alternatives and information overload, which makes decision-making quite challenging. A such method for helping people make judgments is the recommender system (RS), which suggests or forecasts product ratings. The three main types of reinforcement learning (RS) that employ implicit or explicit feedback for recommendation are content-based, collaborative, and hybrid filtering. Although ratings are the most popular type of feedback, other forms like as product descriptions, reviews, photos, audios, and videos can also be useful in enhancing the functionality of the conventional RS. The performance of RS may be significantly impacted by these other factors. Thanks to recent developments in artificial intelligence and deep learning, RSs are currently being built utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which may effectively leverage auxiliary information. Traditional RSs employed methodologies based on the closest neighbor or other machine learning models. This article offers a thorough analysis of CNN-based RSs and how they could employ different kinds of supplementary information, in addition to comparing them on common grounds. The research also covers supplementary information included in a range of publicly accessible datasets, data statistics, and data features. Additionally, many metrics for evaluating RSs are covered, and readers are presented with thought-provoking problems and unresolved research questions.
