This study explores the complex interrelationships between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Investment Decisions (ID), and Emotional Intelligence (EI) in the context of the changing financial decision-making environment. Our research aims to disentangle the intricate relationship between human and machine intelligence by examining the direct impact of human emotional intelligence on investment decisions and clarifying the mediation function of AI in this process. Empirical investigation reveals that EI influences ID directly as well as indirectly through routes mediated by AI. The results highlight the critical role that emotional awareness plays in investor decision-making, which is further enhanced by AI's technological prowess. It implies that while making financial decisions, the majority of investors are impacted by the recognized emotional intelligence. Additionally, AI has a significant influence on investors' decision-making process; yet, AI mediates the link between emotional intelligence and investment choices to some extent. This comprehensive knowledge highlights the necessity for holistic solutions that incorporate emotional and technical components in order to navigate the complexities of contemporary investing environments. It offers insightful information to financial practitioners, legislators, and academics. This study adds to the continuing conversation on the mutually beneficial relationship between human brains and computers in the investing process, as the combination of artificial intelligence and human intuition becomes more and more important in financial decision-making.
