Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms have revolutionized the medical image segmentation processes. Thus, the precise segmentation of organs and their lesions may contribute to an efficient diagnostics process and a more effective selection of targeted therapies, as well as increasing the effectiveness of the training process. In this context, AI may contribute to the automatization of the image scan segmentation process and increase the quality of the resulting 3D objects, which may lead to the generation of more realistic virtual objects. In this paper, we focus on the AI-based solutions applied in medical image scan segmentation and intelligent visual content generation, i.e., computer-generated three-dimensional (3D) images in the context of extended reality (XR). We consider different types of neural networks used with a special emphasis on the learning rules applied, taking into account algorithm accuracy and performance, as well as open data availability. This paper attempts to summarize the current development of AI-based segmentation methods in medical imaging and intelligent visual content generation that are applied in XR. It concludes with possible developments and open challenges in AI applications in extended reality-based solutions. Finally, future lines of research and development directions of artificial intelligence applications, both in medical image segmentation and extended reality-based medical solutions, are discussed.
