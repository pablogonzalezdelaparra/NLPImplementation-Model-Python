## Frameworks Used

The model is built using the following frameworks:

- Python - 3.12.3
- [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) - Python's built-in testing framework
- [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) - Natural Language Toolkit for NLP tasks
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Machine learning library for Python

## How to Run Tests

To run all the tests, execute the following command:

```
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

To run a specific test, execute the following command:

```
python3 -m unittest tests.test_example
```

Replace `test_example` with the name of the specific test module you want to run.

## Getting Started

To get started with the NLP model:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd NLPImplementation-Model-Python
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:

   ```
   python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

5. Start using the NLP model in your own projects by importing and utilizing the `NLPModel` class.
