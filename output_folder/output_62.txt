Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformational force in several fields, including medicine and healthcare. Large language models like ChatGPT highlight AI’s promise by generating human-like writing through prompts. ChatGPT’s versatility holds potential for altering medical practices, increasing patient care, and enhancing interactions among healthcare personnel, patients, and data. In pandemic management, ChatGPT swiftly disseminates crucial information. It serves as a virtual assistant in surgical consultations, supports dental practices, simplifies medical education, and aids in illness diagnostics. A total of 82 papers were categorised into eight major areas, which are G1: treatment and medicine, G2: buildings and equipment, G3: parts of the human body and areas of the disease, G4: patients, G5: citizens, G6: cellular imaging, radiology, pulse and medical images, G7: doctors and nurses, and G8: tools, devices and administration. Balancing AI’s role with human judgment remains a challenge. A systematic literature review employing the PRISMA approach evaluated AI’s transformational potential in healthcare, revealing ChatGPT’s various uses, limitations, motivation, and obstacles. In conclusion, ChatGPT’s numerous medical applications illustrate its potential for innovation, acting as a significant resource for students, professors, and researchers in healthcare. Additionally, this study works as a guide, supporting students, scholars, and researchers in the field of medical and healthcare equally.
