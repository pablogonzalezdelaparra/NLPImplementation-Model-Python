In his keynote session at ICCE 2019, Stephen Yang discussed the emerging challenge of precision education in the context of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and learning analytics to enhance teaching quality and learning performance. The objective of precision education is to promptly identify students who are at risk and offer appropriate assistance based on their teaching and learning experiences (Lu et al., 2018). Based on the central concept of precision education, this special issue promotes a thorough discussion between impersonal technology and compassionate humanity, resulting in a deeper comprehension of precision education. Thirteen research papers focusing on precision education, AI, machine learning, and learning analytics were exchanged for this special issue. These papers aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how AI can be applied in education, covering various applications, methods, pedagogical models, and environments.
