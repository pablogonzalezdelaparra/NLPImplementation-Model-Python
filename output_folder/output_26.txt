Facial recognition technology (FRT) is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology employed during the COVID-19 pandemic to manage the transmission of the virus. As preparations for future pandemics are now in progress, this technology is seen as an effective tool for monitoring affected persons and gathering real-time surveillance data. When used correctly, Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) can assist governments in implementing public health surveillance. This refers to the organized gathering, storage, utilization, and distribution of personal information to identify and control the spread of diseases. However, FRT also poses ethical and legal dilemmas. These include the potential use of FRT without obtaining consent from the individuals being monitored, the safeguarding of biometric data collected during surveillance, and the possibility of this information being utilized for purposes other than public health. Although widely implemented in nations like Russia and China, western jurisdictions are significantly more hesitant to embrace it, both for pandemic-related objectives and in other contexts.
