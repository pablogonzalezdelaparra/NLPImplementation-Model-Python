Fuzzy logic-based quantification of usability expectation for an m-commerce mobile application is a way of quantifying the usability of a mobile application by applying fuzzy logic principles. The usability of any mobile application is used to find out the user experience of the mobile application by assessing the user's expectations and preferences. Fuzzy logic always be the ideal choice for quantification. Fuzzy logic-based quantification of usability expectation examines the user experience of an m-commerce mobile application by taking into account the user's needs, preferences, and expectations. Usability expectation also takes into account the ability of the user to understand and interact with the application, the degree to which the program meets the user's expectations, and the overall satisfaction with the application. This approach helps to find areas of improvement, enabling the developers to make essential adjustments for a better user experience. This study discusses to construction of a usability metric framework and then assesses the overall usability quality of an m-commerce mobile application with the assistance of fuzzy logic. The suggested usability metric framework is based on the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach and is designed to give a thorough and systematic approach to build metrics to measure the qualitative element of mobile phone applications. The framework has been designed and tested in an m-commerce environment and provides a set of measurable criteria to quantify m-commerce mobile applications as per standard. The results of the evaluation can then be utilized to improve m-commerce mobile applications and to ensure that the user experience is optimized
