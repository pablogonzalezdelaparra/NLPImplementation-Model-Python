In this article, the reasons of technical disturbances in electrical systems are considered, and numerous specific shortcomings of the protection and automation of elements of electrical systems are noted. The propensity to diminish the reliability of relay protection linked with the move from analog to digital types of protection is proven. Based on the examined cases, the usage of fuzzy logic in safeguards, the practicality of employing fuzzy logic elements in protection devices, and the automation of electrical systems to recognize types of short circuits are justified. This article explores the most common damages and gives the findings of modeling an electrical system with transformer coupling, where all sorts of asymmetric short circuits were initiated. The dynamics of changes in the symmetrical components of short-circuit currents of the forward, reverse, and zero sequences are determined. Rules have been devised for the identification of asymmetric types of short circuits. An algorithm of protection and automation operation employing fuzzy logic elements has been devised. The proposed algorithm of protection and automation will shorten the time to determine the type of damage and trigger protections.
