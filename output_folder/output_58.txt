Network news serves as a crucial means for netizens to acquire social knowledge. The abundance of news content impedes netizens from accessing crucial information. Named entity recognition technology, when applied in an artificial setting, can accurately classify information such as location names and dates inside text data. This article integrates named entity recognition and deep learning technology. More precisely, the suggested technique presents an automated method for labeling Chinese entity triggers and a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that may attain high precision using a little amount of training data. The approach simultaneously trains sentence and trigger vectors using a trigger-matching network. The trigger vectors are then used as attention queries for future sequence annotation models. In addition, the suggested approach utilizes entity labels to accurately identify newly coined terms in web news. This allows for the modification of the set of words that are considered sensitive and the ability to adjust the number of words within that set. Furthermore, it expands the web news word sentiment lexicon, enhancing the ability to observe sentiment. The experimental results show that the suggested model performs better than the standard BiLSTM-CRF model. It achieves greater performance using only 20% of the training data set, compared to the conventional model which requires 40% of the training data set. Furthermore, the loss function curve demonstrates that my model achieves superior accuracy and faster convergence speed compared to the model being compared. Ultimately, my model attains a mean accuracy rate of 97.88% in detecting sentiment viewpoints.
