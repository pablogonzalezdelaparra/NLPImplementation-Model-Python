Tumor segmentation in breast ultrasound (US) pictures is a crucial concern in the field of medical imaging. Due to the low quality of US pictures and the varied specifications of US machines, segmentation and categorization of anomalies create difficulties even for expert radiologists. The research presents a new AI-based hybrid model for US segmentation that achieves high accuracy, uses minimal datasets, and can handle unfamiliar data. The program can be utilized for diagnostics and the US-guided biopsies. A new and resilient hybrid technique that combines deep learning (DL) and multi-agent artificial life (AL) has been introduced. The algorithms undergo verification using three datasets from the United States. The technique outperforms 14 selected state-of-the-art algorithms applied to US pictures characterized by complicated geometry and high level of noise. The study includes an innovative classification of the photos and tests to examine the limits of the DL. The model has been trained and verified on 1264 ultrasound pictures. The photos are in the JPEG and PNG formats. The age of the patients spans from 22 to 73 years. The 14 benchmark algorithms cover deformable forms, edge linking, superpixels, machine learning, and DL approaches. The tests use eight-region shape- and contour-based evaluation measures. The proposed method (DL-AL) produces excellent results in terms of the dice coefficient (region) and the relative Hausdorff distance H3 (contour-based) as follows: the easiest image complexity level, Dice = 0.96 and H3 = 0.26; the medium complexity level, Dice = 0.91 and H3 = 0.82; and the hardest complexity level, Dice = 0.90 and H3 = 0.84. All other metrics follow the same pattern. The DL-AL outperforms the second best (Unet-based) technique by 10–20%. The approach has been also tested by a variety of unorthodox tests. The model was trained on low complexity photos and applied to the whole set of images. These results are summarized below. (1) Only the low complexity images have been utilized for training (68% unknown images): Dice = 0.80 and H3 = 2.01. (2) The low and the medium complexity images have been used for training (51% unknown images): Dice = 0.86 and H3 = 1.32. (3) The low, medium, and hard complexity images have been employed for training (35% unknown images): Dice = 0.92 and H3 = 0.76. These studies reveal a considerable advantage of DL-AL over 30%
