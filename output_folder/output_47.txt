As AI systems grow more prevalent in our world, the likelihood of encountering contentious use cases that have a big impact on people's lives increases. Therefore, the growing problem lies in raising awareness about AI prejudice that has the potential to impact impoverished populations. In order to investigate the impact of Virtual Reality on empathy, we conducted a controlled experiment in a laboratory setting. Participants were exposed to a biased Wizard of Oz AI while assuming different personas that differed in their ability to achieve high financial credit scores based on age and gender. Our study revealed that when participants assumed different identities in virtual reality (VR), they experienced a notable increase in empathy towards the characters they embodied. Additionally, they judged the artificial intelligence (AI) as much less fair when compared to a baseline condition where they just imagined being these characters. Moreover, we analyze disparities between embodied personas and examine qualitative findings to obtain a deeper understanding of how participants develop their mental models.
