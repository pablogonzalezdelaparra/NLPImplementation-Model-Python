This study navigates artificial intelligences recent breakthroughs and increased media attention. A prominent focus is made on Eliezer Yudkowsky, a leading figure within the realm of artificial intelligence alignment, who strives to bridge the knowledge gap between popular conceptions and rationalist viewpoints on artificial intelligence technology. This section investigates his expected path of action for artificial intelligence detailed within his unpublished work AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities. This is achieved by seeking to grasp the concept of intelligence itself and identifying a reasonable working definition of that term. The concept of intelligence is then applied to contemporary artificial intelligence capabilities and advances to understand its applicability to the technologies. This research finds contemporary artificial intelligence systems are, to some extent, intelligent. However, it argues that both weak and strong artificial intelligence systems, devoid of human-defined goals, would not inherently pose existential threats to humanity, challenging the notions of artificial intelligence alignment, bringing into question the validity of Nick Bostroms Orthogonality Thesis. Furthermore, the idea of artificial life constructed through the approach of assembling numerous modules each simulating a separate mind function is considered.
