Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) is a method that has become exceedingly sensitive, versatile, and efficient for material analysis. By utilizing thermochemical methods, IGC offers valuable understanding of the physicochemical properties of materials, including dispersive surface free energy, Gibbs surface energy components, and Guttamann Lewis acid-base parameters. This extensive overview explores the historical context, equipment, and wide-ranging uses of IGC. Valuable material regarding the selection and description of various models utilized in IGC experiments is available for researchers and practitioners. IGC has diverse applications in sectors such as polymers, pharmaceuticals, minerals, surfactants, and nanomaterials. In addition, IGC enables the quantification of significant factors such as sorption enthalpy and entropy, dispersive and specific surface energy components, co/adhesion work, glass transition temperature, surface heterogeneity, miscibility, solubility parameters, and specific surface area. These insights enhance comprehension of material behavior and assist in the design and optimization of innovative materials. Furthermore, the incorporation of computer vision and image processing methods into IGC has improved our comprehension of the complex surface texture, roughness, and associated characteristics of materials. The combination of IGC, computer vision, and AI offers promising prospects for further investigation into chemical materials, creating fresh pathways for research and exploration. This study presents a thorough examination of IGC, including its methodology and applications. Additionally, it emphasizes the potential benefits of merging IGC with AI and computer vision.
