This study provides an experience in employing an Artificial Life competitive game that simulates an artificial life environment for unstructured and informal Artificial Intelligence (AI) instruction to students from computer science engineering vocations. The game consists of a virtual Petri dish where two colonies of microorganisms-software agents-must struggle to survive. To attain this purpose, the participants must adopt surviving tactics for their agents, which include fighting methods and basic reproduction laws to prevail over all the artificial environment. The technical bases of the challenge as well as a description of the artificial life model are discussed in detail. The pedagogical experience gathered in the contest development is discussed, as well as the ensuing learning experience, which aroused students interest and has helped them to develop mental models of prospective AI algorithms.
