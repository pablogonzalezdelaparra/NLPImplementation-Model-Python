In this study, Self-Reproduction feature of Artificial Life is brought to computer animation. A Self-Reproduction model of Artificial Fish based on gene control is put forward and produced. Based on Artificial Fish's phenotypic, the contents of its chromosome are given. Based on this model, heredity rules are offered. Artificial Fish could multiply and grow in the virtual marine environment freely regulated by the gene model and laws. Artificial behaviors include predetermined behaviors and nondeterminate behaviors. Cognitive models based on Artificial Intelligence is put forth and constructed to govern behaviors of artificial fish in high level. Simulation program is established and developed based on all these models built above. These made foundations to increase the efficiency and automation level of artificial fish animation.
