This study investigates the ethical problems and regulatory dynamics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in regard to data integrity and its influence on social dynamics. Employing a cross-sectional survey approach, primary data was obtained from 650 AI practitioners across several sectors, comprising developers, data scientists, ethicists, and policymakers. The study explored the relationships between regulatory compliance, ethical awareness, professional training, and experience in AI practice with the success of AI installation and data integrity. The findings demonstrated a substantial positive association between higher levels of regulatory compliance and perceived efficacy in AI implementation, as well as between AI ethical awareness and data integrity assurance. Moreover, a substantial association was identified between professional training in AI and its good impact on social dynamics. However, experience in the AI sector, while positively connected, revealed a lesser link to data integrity, demonstrating that experience alone is insufficient for assuring effective AI practices. The study underscores the relevance of ethical issues, legal frameworks, and professional training in determining AI development and its societal repercussions. The necessity for dynamic, adaptive, and inclusive regulatory frameworks that may align AI practices with social values and ethical norms is underlined. Future research directions include investigating AI ethics and governance in varied cultural contexts and the impact of emerging technologies like quantum computing on AI ethics.
