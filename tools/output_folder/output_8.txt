This article highlights five major areas of disagreement that deserve careful consideration in future discussions and decision-making, given the rapid growth of interest and debate surrounding AI in education. The following actions should be taken: (1) Concentrate on discussing AI technologies that currently exist, rather than exaggerating the potential of speculative AI technologies; (2) Clearly emphasize the limitations of AI in terms of modeling social contexts and simulating human intelligence, reasoning, autonomy, and emotions; (3) Highlight the negative social consequences of using AI; (4) Recognize that claims about AI are influenced by personal values; and (5) Give more consideration to the environmental and ecological sustainability of ongoing AI development and implementation. Therefore, contrary to common beliefs that AI is an impartial instrument, it is argued that the utilization of AI in education should be seen as a political act that affects different groups of individuals in different educational settings.
